# Mabina Cawood
<span class="subhead">Sword Coast North</span>
![Mabina](../../ðŸ—„-assets/attachments/mabina.jpg#portrait)

A woman bustled around her cart. The layers and hood of her robe made it hard to figure out her age. The best that could be determined is not a kid and not a crone.

*Female human wizard, chaotic good*  
- **Ideal** Magic should be used to protect and improve the lives of the common people
- **Bond** I had a rival all throughout my training, we still compete.
- **Flaw** I can get so distracted by the mystery and wonder of magic that I can forget I'm supposed to be fighting another Wizard.
- **Motivation** When exposed to some new piece of magic, I can't help by try to figure out what it does and how it works.

## Details
<span class="subhead">Student of Magic, Commoner</span>

Through her own magical means, Mabina and her wagon traverse the Sword Coast North, trading magical items. Trade in magical items is a dicey busines, but it is one that Mabina loves with all her heart.


## Relationships

**Faction** Mabina is a member of the [Harpers](../../faerÃ»n/groups/harpers.md)

Friends in Phandalin:
- Harbin Wester, the Townmaster
- Mutual respect for Lord Kyle and the Dragonbane
- [Sister Garaele](phandalin/sister-garaele.md)

## Secrets

She has some kind of friendship or kinship with Harbin from an event that happened long ago. Because of that event, Harbin trusts trading magic items with her. 

The Dragonbane traded "The Splendiferous Bauble" to her for the Handy Haversack. She was able to trade it for a [legendary Ring of Djinni Summoning][1]. She uses it to summon a female djinni named **Desri** from the Elemental Plane of Air. Desri casts the druid spell "Wind Walk" on herself, her horse, and (by special favor) her cart. Mabina can now travel much farther much faster, and has to spend a lot less time out on the open road between towns.

She makes a point of being both respectful and kind to Desri, including bringing things that Desri can trade on her own plane, to ensure the binding is mutually beneficial.
