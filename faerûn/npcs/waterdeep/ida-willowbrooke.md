# Ida Willowbrooke
<span class="subhead">[The Nymphâ€™s Knickers](../../places/waterdeep/the-nymphs-knickers.md), Dock Ward of Waterdeep</span>

Ida is soft-spoken, and self-contained. Her voice is rich, probably a contralto. Her long dark hair, which she keeps in loosely complicated braids, somehow conveys.. comfort? You see her, and you want to curl up nearby and pour out your life story and have her tell you everything is going to be great. 

She has a natural talent for making people feel comfortable. She knows how to handle folk of all types, as she has literally seen (and heard) them all.

> You then also notice a woman at a quieter table off to the side of the room.  While her hair was braided, it was still soft around her face. A kind of pile tumble braid. Artfully un-artful. A huge contrast to the overdone hair of the nobility. Wow. Who knew you could have that reaction to seeing someone's hair?
