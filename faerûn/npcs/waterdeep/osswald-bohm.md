# Osswald Bohm
<span class="subhead">Harness maker, Saddlers' and Harness-makers' Guild, Southern Ward of Waterdeep</span>

He is an attractive man, lean and moderately muscular. His clothes are plain, but well-made, hidden as they are by a well-worn leather work apron. His dark hair is pulled back into a short pony tail at the nape of his neck.

Resourceful. Taps his fingers while thinking.
He is honest, calm and lighthearted.

## Details
His apron is interesting. While it is leather, it has a few patches of fabric that seem to hold stout needles, and few covered pockets that make a soft noise that reminds you of coins when he moves. Other loops and pockets hold recognizable tools, like awls, but also truly ghastly looking plier-type things. Fascinating.
