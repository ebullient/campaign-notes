# Paul Cribari
<span class="subhead">[The Baker's Dozen](../../places/waterdeep/the-bakers-dozen.md), Dock Ward of Waterdeep</span>

A quiet man, Paul focuses on making good bread for the hard-working folk of the Dock Ward. It isn't anything fancy, but it is good quality, and his customers know it.

He is not a fighter, and prefers to be at home and out of the street fairly early.

## Details
He often goes to [The Nymphâ€™s Knickers](../../places/waterdeep/the-nymphs-knickers.md) just after lunch time, when most of his bread has been purchased, and the Nymph's Knickers is less crowded. They sometimes play a quiet game that resembles cribbage, or just talk quietly about goings on in the Ward.

- Enamored with [Ida Willowbrooke](ida-willowbrooke.md)

## Secrets
He is totally in love with Ida, but doesn't believe he has any chance in having that affection returned.
