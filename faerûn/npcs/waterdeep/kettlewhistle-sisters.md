     - wears her hair tied up (bun or braids, but always up and out of the way).

 - **Lidda Kettlewhistle** (analyst) ^lidda
     - uses flowery speech and long words
     - ties her hair up when she's working on books and records, but prefers to wear it down otherwise.

 - **[Nora](../../gm-nora.md) Kettlewhistle** (guardian) ^nora
     - uses colorful oaths and exclamations; tough as nails
     - short hair
     - means business, and woe betide if you mess with her sisters.
 - **Trym Kettlewhistle** (maker) ^trym
     - bites fingernails; multiple piercings on both ears; 
     - messy bun, loose braids. 
     - loves cooking, baking, crafting, making; any creative endeavor, food related or otherwise, is her favorite thing.
