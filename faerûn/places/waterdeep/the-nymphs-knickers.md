# The Nymph’s Knickers
<span class="subhead">Tavern and Festhall, Dock Ward of Waterdeep</span>

The tavern fills the ground floor of a two-story building of timber and brick walls. The tables and benches are well-made, able to withstand obvious use and abuse by patrons that aren't always gentle after a full day of back-breaking manual labor.

- **Owner** The innkeeper is a proud female elf named **Keelta**. She seems to know every rogue and thief in town.
- **Location** Street of Curtains in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep

> As you enter the tavern, you're welcomed by overall happiness and cheerful singing. The bartender is extremely busy, but still manages to welcome you with a wave. You make eye contact with the bard in the corner who is doing great work managing the mood of the place. While he has taken things in a different direction than you would have, it's clear that everyone in here is loving every minute of it.
> 
> You do notice something about the smaller tables. There is a single lovely, if not beautiful, humanoid sat at each. A halfling in a thronelike chair, with the most remarkable light hazel eyes that catch the light in a fascinating way. She sees you looking, and gives you a crooked grin and a wink. A male dwarf sits at another table. You wouldn't be able to name a feature about him, but he is definitely eye-catching.
>  
> You then also notice a woman at a quieter table off to the side of the room. That baker from [The Baker's Dozen](the-bakers-dozen.md) was right, her hair is amazing. While her hair was braided, it was still soft around her face. A kind of pile tumble braid. Artfully un-artful. A huge contrast to the overdone hair of the nobility. Wow. Who knew you could have that reaction to seeing someone's hair? 

Sitting next to Ida is like therapy. Her long dark hair, which she keeps in loosely complicated braids, somehow conveys.. comfort? It doesn't make any sense. You see her, and you want to curl up nearby and pour out your life story and have her tell you everything is going to be great. Her voice is rich, probably a contralto?
