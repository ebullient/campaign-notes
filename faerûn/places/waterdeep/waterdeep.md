# Waterdeep
<span class="subhead">City of Splendors, Sword Coast North</span>

Waterdeep, also known as the City of Splendors or the Crown of the North, is the most important and influential city in the North and perhaps in all FaerÃ»n.

It is one of, if not the, most powerful and influential member-states of the Lords' Alliance.

Waterdeep is a bustling, crowded, busy mercantile city where coin is king and tolerance for people of all races and religion is high. Waterdhavians live life at a fast pace, and despite their fervent work ethic, they rarely miss an opportunity to celebrate, with festivals often going on all day and all night. In Waterdeep, wealth brings respect, respect earns influence, and influence is power.

- **Government:** The city is governed by the Masked Lords, an anonymous group of representatives who are in turn led by the Open Lord of Waterdeep, [Laeral Silverhand](../../npcs/waterdeep/laeral-silverhand.md)
- **Economy:** Economic activity in Waterdeep has been dominated by the cityâ€™s dozens of guilds for more than three centuries, and virtually all commerce flows through them.
- **Law** The [City Watch](../../../rowen/duet/miscellanea/volos-guide/volos-guide-2-surviving.md#City%20Watch) enforces the day-today law in the city, while the Magisters act as judge and jury. Both are swift to mete out justice as needed and are guided by the [The Code Legal](../../../rowen/duet/miscellanea/the-code-legal.md).
- **Military:** The [The Griffon Cavalry](../../../rowen/duet/miscellanea/volos-guide/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#The%20Griffon%20Cavalry) defends the city from outside threats, along with the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors.

## Notes

Waterdeep is divided into a number of city wards: 
- [Castle Ward](castle-ward.md): This central ward encompassed Mount Waterdeep and much of the government of the city.
- [City of the Dead](../../../rowen/duet/miscellanea/volos-guide/volos-guide-3-wards.md#City%20of%20the%20Dead): 
- [Dock Ward](dock-ward.md)
- Downshadow, uppermost level of Undermountain. Plague drove most from Downshadow and the Warrens.
- [Field Ward](field-ward.md)
- Mistshore (not strictly a ward). After the Spellplague the northern section of Waterdeep harbor became dilapidated with most of the harbor choked with sunken ship hulls. This section became known as Mistshore. Mostly cleaned up these days, only a few wrecks remain.
- Mountainside
- [North Ward](north-ward.md)
- [Sea Ward](sea-ward.md)
- [Southern Ward](southern-ward.md)
- [Trades Ward](trades-ward.md)
- [Undercliff](undercliff-ward.md)
- [Undermountain](undermountain.md)

It is a city of laws molded by Tyr's spirit of justice. As a rule, you can trust members of the City Watch to do their duty diligently, and you can expect that the city's magisters will be fair. 

If you have cause to come before the Masked Lords or the Open Lord herself, rest assured that if your cause be just, justice will be done.
