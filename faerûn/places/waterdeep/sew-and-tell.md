# Sew and Tell
<span class="subhead">Tailor, Trades Ward of Waterdeep</span>

This is a small shop on the ground floor of a two-story building in good repair. The sign above the door of this modest building is shaped like a thimble. 

The shop windows let in a good amount of light. 

Footstools and short step ladders of various styles are sprinkled between dressed and undressed mannequins, and racks holding ready made, well-constructed common and traveler's clothes. 

- **Owner** [Eldon Highhill](../../npcs/waterdeep/eldon-highhill.md)
- **Location** Between Mhaer's Alley and Revon Street, across from the [City of the Dead](../../../rowen/duet/miscellanea/volos-guide/volos-guide-3-wards.md#City%20of%20the%20Dead)

There is a glass cabinet behind the counter to the left that is chock full of thimbles.
