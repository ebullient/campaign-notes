# Sword Mountains
*Mountain range in the [North Sword Coast](North%20Sword%20Coast.md)*

Steep, craggy, snow-capped mountains are home to scattered tribes of orcs and monsters.

Icespire Peak is among then,

Their foothills are strewn with ruins of bygone kingdoms, and more than a few half-forgotten dungeons and tombs.
