# Starmetal Hills
*Range of hills in the [North Sword Coast](North%20Sword%20Coast.md)*

Range of rocky knolls is so named because the area has been an impact site of a number of meteor showers over millennia.

The hills are haunted by ruthless barbarian tribes, giving others little reason to visit the area.
