# Wandering Monsters
1. If adventure has wandering monster table, use that.
2. Random encounter rules and Monster lists from DMG
3. Tables from Solo Adventurer's Toolbox
4. 1d3 enemies of type you've already encountered in the adventure (for solo encounter)

Wandering monsters should be relatively low-level: nuisance and resource drain, not a boss fight.

## Random encounters
- Create urgency
- Establish atmosphere (thematically linked creatures)
- Drain resources
- Provide assistance (alternate to fighting)
- Add interest (details about world)
- Reinforce themes

Create a random encounter table for your adventure: types of creature, likihood of occurring, arrange results in a table: single monster or NPC, group of monsters or NPCs, random event or random discovery.
