# Stonehill Inn
*Inn, [Phandalin](Phandalin.md)*

The Stonehill Inn was just the place to find welcome in Phandalin. A newly built fieldstone and timber roadhouse, it was one of the only two-story buildings in the town. Situated where the Triboar trail and the Minerâ€™s trail met in the center of town, the common room of the inn was always filled with a smattering of locals catching a meal or relaxing with friends over mugs of ale or cider.

**Owner** [Toblen Stonehill](Toblen%20Stonehill.md)
