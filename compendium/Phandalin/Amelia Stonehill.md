## Secrets

## History

From "A Messy Morning":

> Toblen saw the two men sitting at the counter talking to his wife, Amelia. He couldn’t hear them over the murmur in the room, but their conversation was full of chuckles and wry glances, and that made him smile. Amelia was always pleased when their guests were entertaining.

> ... The two fighters both turned from the counter, noticing the elf and the dwarves, probably due to Amelia’s disapproving glare... Toblen could tell by his wife’s face that the elf would not be welcome in the inn again.

From "A Rough Time in Phandalin":

> John and Kyle spoke for a bit with Amelia, who told them something had happened to Thel, the local woodcarver. She was really worried about him and his family, as they hadn’t been seen for a few days. He’d tossed some ne’er-do-wells out of his shop for threatening his wife and daughters. Three days ago he’d disappeared. Two days ago, his wife and daughters disappeared, too. Phandalin was a small town, but it had its share of bandits nipping around the edges of town. It was close enough to both the Highroad and the Triboar Trail to make it a frequent restocking stop for travelers and caravans going to and from the city of Neverwinter. Nothing like this had ever happened before.
