## Secrets

## History

Qelline Alderleaf was out in the fields weeding. While she held a hoe in her hand, it was obvious she was the hands-on type, as she was covered in mud. She was excited to hear stories of their recent adventures, especially those of the manticores and the ankhegs, but she confessed to having bad dreams lately. She spent most of her time outside, and had seen the dragon in the sky more than once. In her nightmares, the dragon swooped down and carried her off, leaving her son to grow up parentless. In other dreams, it was Carp that was carried off. Something needed to be done about that dragon.
