# Townmaster's Hall
*Common building, [Phandalin](Phandalin.md)*

The townmaster’s hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. The job board next to the front door features a sparse number of notices, all written in Common, and in the same hand.

Townmaster, https://trello.com/c/ANg7F4Z4, serves as judge in minor disputes and keeps required records.

The townmaster’s hall has a small but serviceable jail in the cellar with two cells. Harbin carries the keys to the cell doors.
