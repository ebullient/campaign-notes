### History

Nestled in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, morning mist would often lurk between the town’s buildings and swirl across the narrow, uneven roads until the sun crested a nearby ridge and chased it away.

The town had an interesting history. Long ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made a pact to share a nearby mine rich in both minerals and magic. Phandalin grew and prospered at the cross-section of two roads passing near this and other mines in the area. But war and orcs arrived. The town was decimated and abandoned, and knowledge of the mines was lost.

Settlers from Neverwinter and Waterdeep eventually began to resettle the area to search for the old mines. They rebuilt Phandalin in the heart of the town’s ruins, sometimes reusing old fieldstone foundations. The new buildings hugged the narrow streets, while crumbled leftovers of buildings dotted the surrounding landscape. Ivy and briar covered hummocks of stone marked where the old town walls used to be.

Phandalin’s new residents were quiet, hard-working folk who came from distant cities to eke out a life amid the harsh wilderness. They were farmers, stonecutters, blacksmiths, traders, prospectors, and their families. The town had no walls and no garrison, and most of the adults kept weapons within easy reach just in case, but visitors were welcome, especially if they had coin to spend or news to share.

Local people, living around the area of Phandalin can be expected to know the following information about the area:

* The original Phandalin town established and ruled by the Tresendar family for a number of generations until it was raided and destroyed by Orcs about five centuries ago. The town was abandoned afterwards.
* Frontiersmen from Neverwinter and Waterdeep settled the new town about a decade previous as a spot for miners to operate from when searching the Sword Mountains.

Phandalin is not well known outside of the region.
