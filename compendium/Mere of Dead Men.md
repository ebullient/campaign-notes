# Mere of Dead Men
*Creepy place along the [High Road](High%20Road.md), [North Sword Coast](North%20Sword%20Coast.md)*

Travelers on the High Road, which skirts the mere to the east, must resist being lured into this cold, desolate swamp by bobbing will-oâ€™-wisps.

Many adventurers have died here, drawn by tales of ruined castles half-sunk in the mire.
