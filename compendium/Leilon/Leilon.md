# Leilon
*Recovering town on the [High Road](High%20Road.md)*

Small town that is rebuilding itself after being abandoned for years. 

Inhabitants hail from Neverwinter, and are in the paid service of the Lord Protector, who has tasked them with turning Leilon into a fortified settlement that can ward off threats from the [Mere of Dead Men](Mere%20of%20Dead%20Men.md).
