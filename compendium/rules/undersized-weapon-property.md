# Undersized Weapon Property
(5e Variant Rule)

A weapon with the undersized property is particularly small. They can be easily hidden, and are favoured by tiny races.

An undersized one-handed weapon is considered to be a light weapon (PHB p. 147). This means a Tiny creature can wield an undersized weapon and use it with two-weapon fighting.

*Undersized* melee weapons never also have the two-handed property, as this would simply be a normal one-handed weapon or weapon with the versatile property.
