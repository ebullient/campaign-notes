# Movement

While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace. 

Table shows distance traveled per minute, hour or day at given pace.

| Pace  | Minute   | Hour   | Day  | Effect  |
|-------|----------|--- -----|------| ------ |
|Fast    | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles | −5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores |
|Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles | — |
|Slow    | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles | Able to use Stealth |
|Wind Walk Fast| 4000 feet | 40 miles | 320 miles | — |
|Wind Walk Normal| 3000 feet | 30 miles | 240 miles | — |
|Wind Walk Slow| 2000 feet | 20 miles | 160 miles | — |

Table assumes 8 hours. Can push beyond that limit, at the risk of Exhaustion (see below)

## Forced March

For each additional hour of Travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.

The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of Exhaustion (see [Exhaustion](conditions.md#Exhaustion)).

## Mounts and Vehicles 

For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than Humanoids. 

A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh Mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in **wagons**, carriages, or other Land Vehicles choose a pace as normal. 

Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to Travel for up to 24 hours per day.

## Wind Walk

You and up to *ten willing creatures* you can see within range assume a *Gaseous Form* for the Duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. 

While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has Resistance to damage from nonmagical Weapons. The only Actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. 

Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is Incapacitated and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.
