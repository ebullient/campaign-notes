# Magic Item Trade

## Buying a magic item

**Resources**. Finding magic items to purchase requires *at least one workweek of effort* and *100 gp* in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item. The monetary cost should include a wealthy lifestyle, for a buyer must impress potential business partners.

**Resolution.** A character seeking to buy a magic item makes a **Charisma (Persuasion)** check to determine the quality of the seller found. 
- *Bonus*: The character gains a +1 bonus on the check for every workweek beyond the first that is spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent on the search, up to a maximum bonus of +10.

As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of the check dictates which table in the Dungeon Master's Guide to roll on to determine which items are on the market. Or you can roll for items from any table associated with a lower total on the Buying Magic Items table. As a further option to reflect the availability of items in your campaign, you can apply a -10 penalty for low magic campaigns or a +10 bonus for high magic campaigns. Furthermore, you can double magic item costs in low magic campaigns.

Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign prices to the available items, based on their rarity. Halve the price of any consumable item, such as a potion or a scroll, when using the table to determine an asking price.

### Magic Item Purchase Complications

The magic item trade is fraught with peril. The large sums of money involved and the power offered by magic items attract thieves, con artists, and other villains. If you want to make things more interesting for the characters, roll on the Magic Item Purchase Complications table or invent your own complication.

| dice: d12 | Complication |
|-----------|-------------- |
| 1 | The item is a fake, planted by an enemy.* |
| 2 | The item is stolen by the party's enemies.* |
| 3 | The item is cursed by a god. |
| 4 | The item's original owner will kill to reclaim it; the party's enemies spread news of its sale.* |
| 5 | The item is at the center of a dark prophecy. |
| 6 | The seller is murdered before the sale.* |
| 7 | The seller is a devil looking to make a bargain. |
| 8 | The item is the key to freeing an evil entity. |
| 9 | A third party bids on the item, doubling its price.* |
| 10 | The item is an enslaved, intelligent entity. |
| 11 | The item is tied to a cult. |
| 12 | The party's enemies spread rumors that the item is an artifact of evil.* |

## Selling a Magic Item

Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con-artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there's no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.

**Resources.** A character can find a buyer for one magic item by spending one workweek and 25 gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character must pick one item at a time to sell.

**Resolution.** A character who wants to sell an item must make a ==Charisma (Persuasion)== check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price.

### Magic Item Base Prices

| Rarity | Base Price* |
|--------|-------------|
| Common | 100 gp |
| Uncommon | 400 gp |
| Rare | 4,000 gp |
| Very rare | 40,000 gp |
| Legendary | 200,000 gp |

*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

### Magic Item Offer

| Check Total | Offer |
|-------------|-------|
| 1 - 10 | 50% of base price |
| 11 - 20 | 100% of base price |
| 21+ | 150% of base price |

### Magic Item Sale Complications

The main risk in selling a magic item lies in attracting thieves and anyone else who wants the item but doesn't want to pay for it. Other folk might try to undermine a deal in order to bolster their own business or seek to discredit the character as a legitimate seller. Every workweek spent trying to sell an item brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Magic Item Sale Complications table.

| dice: d6 | Magic Item Sale Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Your enemy secretly arranges to buy the item to use it against you.* |
| 2 | A thieves' guild, alerted to the sale, attempts to steal your item.* |
| 3 | A foe circulates rumors that your item is a fake.* |
| 4 | A sorcerer claims your item as a birthright and demands you hand it over. |
| 5 | Your item's previous owner, or surviving allies of the owner, vow to retake the item by force. |
| 6 | The buyer is murdered before the sale is finalized.* |
