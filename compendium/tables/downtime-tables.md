## Buying a magic item

**Resources**. Finding magic items to purchase requires *at least one workweek of effort* and *100 gp* in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item. The monetary cost should include a wealthy lifestyle, for a buyer must impress potential business partners.

**Resolution.** A character seeking to buy a magic item makes a **Charisma (Persuasion)** check to determine the quality of the seller found. 
- *Bonus*: The character gains a +1 bonus on the check for every workweek beyond the first that is spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent on the search, up to a maximum bonus of +10.

As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of the check dictates which table in the Dungeon Master's Guide to roll on to determine which items are on the market. Or you can roll for items from any table associated with a lower total on the Buying Magic Items table. As a further option to reflect the availability of items in your campaign, you can apply a -10 penalty for low magic campaigns or a +10 bonus for high magic campaigns. Furthermore, you can double magic item costs in low magic campaigns.

Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign prices to the available items, based on their rarity. Halve the price of any consumable item, such as a potion or a scroll, when using the table to determine an asking price.

### Buying magic items

| CHA + bonus | Items Acquired |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| 1 - 5   | Roll 1d6 times on [Magic Item Table A](magic-item-tables.md#Magic%20Item%20Table%20A). |
| 6 - 10  | Roll 1d4 times on [Magic Item Table B](magic-item-tables.md#Magic%20Item%20Table%20B). |
| 11 - 15 | Roll 1d4 times on [Magic Item Table C](magic-item-tables.md#Magic%20Item%20Table%20C). |
| 16 - 20 | Roll 1d4 times on [Magic Item Table D](magic-item-tables.md#Magic%20Item%20Table%20D). |
| 21 - 25 | Roll 1d4 times on [Magic Item Table E](magic-item-tables.md#Magic%20Item%20Table%20E). |

### Magic Item Price

| Rarity      | Asking Price (halved for consummable) |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Common      | (1d6 + 1) × 10 gp |
| Uncommon    | 1d6 × 100 gp      |
| Rare        | 2d10 × 1,000 gp |
| Very rare   | (1d4 + 1) × 10,000 gp |
| Legendary   | 2d6 × 25,000 gp |

### Magic Item Purchase Complications

The magic item trade is fraught with peril. The large sums of money involved and the power offered by magic items attract thieves, con artists, and other villains. If you want to make things more interesting for the characters, roll on the Magic Item Purchase Complications table or invent your own complication.

| dice: d12 | Complication |
|-----------|-------------- |
| 1 | The item is a fake, planted by an enemy.* |
| 2 | The item is stolen by the party's enemies.* |
| 3 | The item is cursed by a god. |
| 4 | The item's original owner will kill to reclaim it; the party's enemies spread news of its sale.* |
| 5 | The item is at the center of a dark prophecy. |
| 6 | The seller is murdered before the sale.* |
| 7 | The seller is a devil looking to make a bargain. |
| 8 | The item is the key to freeing an evil entity. |
| 9 | A third party bids on the item, doubling its price.* |
| 10 | The item is an enslaved, intelligent entity. |
| 11 | The item is tied to a cult. |
| 12 | The party's enemies spread rumors that the item is an artifact of evil.* |

## Carousing

Carousing is a default downtime activity for many characters. Between adventures, who doesn't want to relax with a few drinks and a group of friends at a tavern?

**Resources.** Carousing covers a workweek of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local nobility.

A character with the [Noble](../backgrounds/noble.md) background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit and the Deception skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.

**Resolution.** After a workweek of carousing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class. The character makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check using the Carousing table.

| CHA (Persuasion) | Result |
|------------------|--------|
| 1 - 5   | Character has made a hostile contact. |
| 6 - 10  | Character has made no new contacts. |
| 11 - 15 | Character has made an allied contact. |
| 16 - 20 | Character has made two allied contacts. |
| 21+     | Character has made three allied contacts. |
^carousing

Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.
- Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.
- Middle-class contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.
- Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.

Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.

You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.

Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.

Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.

The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.

At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don't count toward this limit - only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.

### Carousing Complications

Characters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town. As a rule of thumb, a character has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each workweek of carousing.

| dice: d8 | Lower-Class Carousing Complication |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | A pickpocket lifts 1d10 × 5 gp from you.* |
| 2 | A bar brawl leaves you with a scar.* |
| 3 | You have fuzzy memories of doing something very, very illegal, but can't remember exactly what. |
| 4 | You are banned from a tavern after some obnoxious behavior.* |
| 5 | After a few drinks, you swore in the town square to pursue a dangerous quest. |
| 6 | Surprise! You're married. |
| 7 | Streaking naked through the streets seemed like a great idea at the time. |
| 8 | Everyone is calling you by some weird, embarrassing nickname, like Puddle Drinker or Bench Slayer, and no one will say why.* |

## Research 

Forewarned is forearmed. The research downtime activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, a magic item, or some other particular topic.

**Resources.** Typically, a character needs access to a library or a sage to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires one workweek of effort and at least 50 gp spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses.

**Resolution.** The character declares the focus of the research - a specific person, place, or thing. After one workweek, the character makes an ==Intelligence check== with a +1 bonus per 50 gp spent beyond the initial 50 gp, to a maximum of +6. In addition, a character who has access to a particularly well-stocked library or knowledgeable sages gains advantage on this check. Determine how much lore a character learns using the Research Outcomes table.

### Research Outcomes

| INT Check Total | Outcome |
|-----------------|---------|
| 1 - 5    | No effect. |
| 6 - 10   | You learn one piece of lore. |
| 11 - 20  | You learn two pieces of lore. |
| 21+      | You learn three pieces of lore. |

Each piece of lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature's resistances, the password needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells commonly prepared by an order of wizards, and so on.

As DM, you are the final arbiter concerning exactly what a character learns. For a monster or an NPC, you can reveal elements of statistics or personality. For a location, you can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place.

### Research Complications

The greatest risk in research is uncovering false information. Not all lore is accurate or truthful, and a rival with a scholarly bent might try to lead the character astray, especially if the object of the research is known to the rival. The rival might plant false information, bribe sages to give bad advice, or steal key tomes needed to find the truth.

In addition, a character might run into other complications during research. Every workweek spent in research brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Research Complications table.

| dice: d6 | Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | You accidentally damage a rare book. |
| 2 | You offend a sage, who demands an extravagant gift.* |
| 3 | If you had known that book was cursed, you never would have opened it. |
| 4 | A sage becomes obsessed with convincing you of a number of strange theories about reality.* |
| 5 | Your actions cause you to be banned from a library until you make reparations.* |
| 6 | You uncovered useful lore, but only by promising to complete a dangerous task in return. |

## Selling a Magic Item

Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con-artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there's no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.

**Resources.** A character can find a buyer for one magic item by spending one workweek and 25 gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character must pick one item at a time to sell.

**Resolution.** A character who wants to sell an item must make a ==Charisma (Persuasion)== check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price.

### Magic Item Base Prices

| Rarity | Base Price* |
|--------|-------------|
| Common | 100 gp |
| Uncommon | 400 gp |
| Rare | 4,000 gp |
| Very rare | 40,000 gp |
| Legendary | 200,000 gp |

*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

### Magic Item Offer

| Check Total | Offer |
|-------------|-------|
| 1 - 10 | 50% of base price |
| 11 - 20 | 100% of base price |
| 21+ | 150% of base price |

### Magic Item Sale Complications

The main risk in selling a magic item lies in attracting thieves and anyone else who wants the item but doesn't want to pay for it. Other folk might try to undermine a deal in order to bolster their own business or seek to discredit the character as a legitimate seller. Every workweek spent trying to sell an item brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Magic Item Sale Complications table.

| dice: d6 | Magic Item Sale Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Your enemy secretly arranges to buy the item to use it against you.* |
| 2 | A thieves' guild, alerted to the sale, attempts to steal your item.* |
| 3 | A foe circulates rumors that your item is a fake.* |
| 4 | A sorcerer claims your item as a birthright and demands you hand it over. |
| 5 | Your item's previous owner, or surviving allies of the owner, vow to retake the item by force. |
| 6 | The buyer is murdered before the sale is finalized.* |

## Training

Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.

**Resources.** Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp per workweek.


### Training Complications

Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. _Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a complication_, examples of which are on the Training Complications table.

| dice: d6 | Training Complication |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Your instructor disappears, forcing you to spend one workweek finding a new one.* |
| 2 | Your teacher instructs you in rare, archaic methods, which draw comments from others. |
| 3 | Your teacher is a spy sent to learn your plans.* |
| 4 | Your teacher is a wanted criminal. |
| 5 | Your teacher is a cruel taskmaster. |
| 6 | Your teacher asks for help dealing with a threat. |

## Work

When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character's attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

**Resources.** Performing a job requires one workweek of effort.

**Resolution.** To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), Intelligence using a set of tools, Charisma (Performance), or Charisma using a musical instrument. Consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check.

### Wages

| Check Total | Earnings |
|-------------|----------|
| 9 or lower | Poor lifestyle for the week |
| 10 - 14 | Modest lifestyle for the week |
| 15 - 20 | Comfortable lifestyle for the week |
| 21+ | Comfortable lifestyle for the week + 25 gp |

### Work Complications

Ordinary work is rarely filled with significant complications. Still, the Work Complications table can add some difficulties to a worker's life. Each workweek of activity brings a 10 percent chance that a character encounters a complication.

| dice: d6 | Complication |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | A difficult customer or a fight with a coworker reduces the wages you earn by one category.* |
| 2 | Your employer's financial difficulties result in your not being paid.* |
| 3 | A coworker with ties to an important family in town takes a dislike to you.* |
| 4 | Your employer is involved with a dark cult or a criminal enterprise. |
| 5 | A crime ring targets your business for extortion.* |
| 6 | You gain a reputation for laziness (unjustified or not, as you choose), giving you disadvantage on checks made for this downtime activity for the next six workweeks you devote to it.* |
