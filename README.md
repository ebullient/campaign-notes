# Campaign Notes

This is the default branch for indexing reasons. The action is in the `main` branch.

The content of this repo are my notes for a smash-up campaign I run for kids. Some is based on modules, and there is some filler, what I expect is the usual.

I use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to create and maintain these notes. Some things will look ugly without it (and some is flat out work-in-progress).

If you want to view this as I do:

1. [Install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). To get some automatic help, you will want to set up the git command line. 

2. Obtain the source by cloning this repository:
    * HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/ebullient/campaign-notes.git`
    * SSH: `git clone git@github.com:ebullient/campaign-notes.git`

3. Check out the `main` branch

4. Install Obsidian.md

5. In Obsidian, [open the cloned repository directory](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults) as a Vault

6. When prompted, *allow* third party plugins.

7. Once Obsidian has started, use the gear icon in the lower right to open settings, and select "Community plugins in the sidebar"

8. Use the toggle sliders on the right side of the dialog to enable all installed plugins. Use Ctrl-R (or Cmd-R) to refresh Obsidian to make sure everything is loaded happily.

9. Some plugins have additional settings, most of those should be checked in.

10. You may want to check at this point if obsidian has made any changes to the repo while reading things. If it has, you can revert those and reload, to make sure you're running with expected settings. If you've made no intentional changes yourself, using `git reset --hard origin/main` will discard all local changes.

Note: Obsidian is basically a specialized kind of browser. When in doubt, refresh the page.
