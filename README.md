# Campaign Notes

This is the default branch for indexing reasons. The action is in the `main` branch.

The content of this repo are my notes for a smash-up campaign I run for kids. Some is based on modules, and there is some filler, what I expect is the usual.

I use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to create and maintain these notes. Some things will look ugly without it (and some is flat out work-in-progress).

If you want to view this as I do:

1. [Install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). To get some automatic help, you will want to set up the git command line. 

2. Obtain the source by cloning this repository:
    * HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/ebullient/campaign-notes.git`
    * SSH: `git clone git@github.com:ebullient/campaign-notes.git`

3. Check out the `main` branch

4. Install Obsidian.md

5. In Obsidian, [open the cloned repository directory](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/How+to/Working+with+multiple+vaults) as a Vault

6. When prompted, allow third party plugins.

Obsidian is basically a specialized kind of browser. When in doubt, refresh the page.
