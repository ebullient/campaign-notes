# GM: Rowen
- Best friend: [Coral](gm-coral.md)
- [Mattrim "Threestrings" Mereg](../waterdeep/npcs/threestrings-mattrim-mereg.md) taught Rowen to play
- [Yagra Stonefist](../waterdeep/npcs/yagra-stonefist.md) and Rowen have gotten into a few scrapes. Love/hate. Yagra also feels a bit of an outcast (Half-orc).
- 10 years old-ish (out of 30)

### Adventure developments
- Rescued [Lord Renaer Neverember](../waterdeep/npcs/renaer-neverember.md), and [Floon Blagmaar](../waterdeep/npcs/floon-blagmaar.md). 
- Borrowed money from [Mirt 'The Moneylender'](../waterdeep/npcs/mirt-the-moneylender.md) to repair [Trollskull Manor](../waterdeep/places/trollskull-manor.md)

### Notes
- *Height*
- *Weight*
- *Carrying capacity*: STR(10) * 15 == 150 lbs
- *Push/drag/lift*: SRT(10) * 30 == 300 lbs (temporary lift, not fly for distance)
- *Amulet of Winged Alter Self*  This amulet can be used to cast a modified version of *alter self* that is specific to winged creatures twice per day. Each cast spell will last for 2 hours, unless intentionally dropped. The caster can not change their size, but can effectively change their race: altering their bodies to remove wings and feathers. The casterâ€™s skills and statistics do not change (they receive no racial benefits of their new form) aside from the removal of their flight speed. Trying to fly will break the spell.
