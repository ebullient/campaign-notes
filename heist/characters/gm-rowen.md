```ad-npc
- **Trait**: I hide scraps of food and trinkets away in my pockets. 
- **Ideal**: Change. The low are lifted up, and the high and mighty are brought down. Change is the nature of things. (Chaotic)
- **Bond**: I owe my survival to another urchin who taught me to live on the streets.
- **Flaw**: It's not stealing if I need it more than someone else.
```

## Traits

*Amulet of Winged Alter Self*  This amulet can be used to cast a modified version of *alter self* that is specific to winged creatures twice per day. Each cast spell will last for 2 hours, unless intentionally dropped. The caster can not change their size, but can effectively change their race: altering their bodies to remove wings and feathers. The casterâ€™s skills and statistics do not change (they receive no racial benefits of their new form) aside from the removal of their flight speed. Trying to fly will break the spell.

***Flight.*** You have a flying speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.

***Silver Tongue.*** You are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

***Song of Rest.*** Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points by spending Hit Dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.
	The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

## Actions
***Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d4 slashing damage.

***Rapier.*** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d8 + 2 piercing damage.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack.* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or 20/60 when thrown, one target. Hit: 1d4 + 2 piercing damage.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack.* +4 to hit, range 150/600, one target. Hit: 1d8 + 2 piercing damage. 

## Bonus Actions

***Bardic Inspiration (CHA: 4/long rest)*** Choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6 (use within 10 min). Die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

***Unsettling Words.*** You can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.
