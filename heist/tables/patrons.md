| ------------ |
| Asks the PCs to host the guild’s Leiruin Feast. (Extrapolate event from DH p. 162.) |

(He relates how the previous year a spice merchant nearly bankrupted an inn who didn’t have insurance when a magister held them liable for not only the magical healing of his injuries, but also for his lost wages during a period of physical and emotional recovery.) |
| Dues for the Fellowship of Innkeepers are increasing by 5 gp per month starting on the first of next month. |

| MATTREM “THREEESTRINGS” MEREG |
| ------------ |
| Looking for employment; or just permission to play for tips if that fails. (Yawning Portal is a little too intense for him this week.) |
| He brings Bonnie the Doppelganger here to have a date. It turns into a complete disaster. (He might beg one of the PCs to help him salvage the night.) |
| Sings “The Ballad of the River Chionthar,” an incredibly beautiful piece of his own composition telling of a young girl who slipped into the river and drowned. Each verse tells of some scene her body passes along the river, until the last verse speaks of how she passed through Baldur’s Gate and out into the sea. |

^mirt

| YAGRA STONEFIST |
| ------------ |
| Challenging any burly-looking patrons to an arm wrestling competition, which she’s turned into a drinking game by taking a drink each time she wins. |
| She claims a table in the corner and over the course of the evening she meets with a string of people – many of them sporting Zhentarim tattoos. She speaks quietly with them or slips them a piece of paper, and then they leave. |
| She gets a crush on one of the male patrons tonight and does her best to take him home. |
| Who wants to arm wrestle?! |

| VAJRA SAFAHR, THE BLACKSTAFF |
| ------------ |
| Lights have been seen in Kolat Towers, an old abandoned wizard’s tower in the Southern Ward. Despite everything that’s happening, she’s going to have to find time to check it out: Reoccupied wizard’s haunts are trouble more often than not. |
| The Xanathar Guild is run by _the_ Xanathar, a beholder. One of a long line of beholders that have adopted the name when they take over the Guild |

| OSCO SALIBUCK |
| ------------ |
| Has just returned from an expedition to the Tomb of Galari, an Archmage of Ancient Netheril. Young Harchan Roaringhorn led the expedition, clearly seeking something of import. (Osco does not know what; and it’s clear that Harchan was unsuccessful in whatever his aim was.) |
| He has ordered one of every single liquor in the tavern, lined them up on the bar, and is working his way through them one by one. He is offering his (increasingly incoherent) critiques of each one at the top of his lungs. |
| Lord Tylandar Roaringhorn is celebrating his seventieth birthday on the Roaringhorn estates in Amphail. Osco will be leaving Waterdeep for a couple of weeks (probably closer to a month), and he wants to have one last big party before he goes. |

^osco

| LORD TORLYN WANDS |
| ------------ |
| Lord Terras, who has had a feud with the Wands ever since Torlyn’s sister turned down his proposal of marriage, has filed yet another civil suit claiming that guests staying at the Wands’ ancestral hunting lodge have crossed over onto his property. He filed the suit in the Court of Amphail, just to make it more of a headache for Torlyn to defend it. |
| Quietly reading *The Salt of the Abyss* by Ableworth Dirkley while sipping tea in the corner. |
| Arrives feeling `dice: [](mood-tables.md#^mood-table)` about a situation involving `dice: [](/assets/tables/situations-verbs.md#^situation-table)` |

| He’s gained a nasty scar across one cheek: One of the apprentices of the Order of Magists let a spell get out of control. |

| Has brought half a dozen dwarven tunnel workers from the Cellarers’ & Plumbers’ Guild to check out the new tavern. |
| Malaerigo Harsard, Guild Master of the Cellarers’ & Plumbers’ Guild, has announced a steep rate hike in the guild’s dues. There’s a great deal of discontent in the rank-and-file, particularly among the dwarves. |
| It’s the anniversary of his nephew’s death: He orders six dwarven ales (one for each year since Dorn’s death) and drinks them one by one. (Others who knew Dorn – like Laraelra, for example – may join in.) |

| PARLEK LATERIFF |
| ------------ |
| Recently acquired Sister Argutara’s Telestic Tome of the Draconic Tribes. Waxes rhapsodic about it. |
| Comparing recent acquisitions with Lord Torlyn Wands. |
| Arguing with Rishaal over the inconsistencies between Arturo’s Moonsea Atlas and Arienthil’s Journeys in the Moonshae Isles. (Parlek is convinced that Arienthil edited her accounts in order to gloss over or conceal various sites of importance she had encountered. He has an elaborate conspiracy theory suggesting, for example, that she was aware of a huge vein of black gold, a rare Feydark ore which is found in deposits throughout the Moonshae Isles and sparks intermittent “black gold rushes” when they turn up.) |
| Arrives feeling `dice: [](mood-tables.md#^mood-table)` about a situation involving `dice: [](/assets/tables/situations-verbs.md#^situation-table)` |

I’m supposed to just be ordering drink, but I recognize one of them as being the wife of Lord Elamyr Belabranta. If Lord Elamyr finds out, he’ll send a griffon to eat me!* (The Belabratas breed griffons for the City Watch.) |
| His friend Bruzmyr Seerambra can offer a much better deal on the cost of liquor and ale than the Vintners’ Guild. |
| His friend Riklyn Harvester has been transformed into an orange tabby cat by an irate sorcerer who was upset that Riklyn was trying to pick up a girl at the Old Skull Tavern. He’s got Riklyn with him (meow!) and he’s hoping the PCs can help turn him back. (Floon is mistaken: The cat is just a cat.) |
