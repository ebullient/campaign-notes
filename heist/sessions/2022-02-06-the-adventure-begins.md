# Session on 2022-02-06: Getting started
<span class="nav"><span>✧</span> ~ ❦ ~ [next →](2022-02-13-looking-for-floon.md)</span>

## Summary
<span class='ob-timelines' data-category='rowen' data-date='1499-Ches-27-00' data-name="Brawl in the Yawning Portal"></span>

A brawl broke out with your friend *Yagra* right as you entered the tavern in the evening on this particular day. You walked in right as the fists started flying. While you tried to diffuse the tension with a staged fall, it was too sudden, and too intense, for your tactic to work as you intended. Yagra knocked the leader of the thugs unconscious with one hit, but his four lackeys jumped on her and beat her sensless before *Durnan* could throw them out, which he did. A well-thrown tankard smacked one of them on the head. You heard the underlings reference the unconscious body as *Krentz* as they scooped him up and ran for the exit.  

Relieved to find Yagra still alive (and merely unconsicous), you sat down next to her for a moment (Bonnie brought you an ale), to wait for her to come around. Before that could happen, a *Troll*  crawled into the taproom from the portal to Undermountain! Everyone panicked, freaked out, and made themselves scarce except for you, Threestrings, and Durnan, who pulled a greatsword from somewhere and launched himself at the thing. He shouted instructions about dealing with stirges and dousing the troll with fire when it fell, but otherwise trusted those instructions to be followed by.. someone. You and Threestrings worked together to kill the sturges (you killed 2, he killed 1), and you and Nibbles managed to cut through the rope holding up the chandelier, causing it to crash onto the troll for the kill (and simultaneously dousing it with lamp oil, which Durnan quickly set alight). It was a brilliant tag-team. 

Threestrings healed Yagra, and then retreated to his usual place in the taproom to start playing music that would help return things to normal. You went over to sit near him, and Bonnie brought you a top-notch meal on the house (with a stern nod of thanks from Durnan, which is high praise indeed). Yagra and Durnan managed to roll the troll body up and over the wall to fall back down into the depths of the pit for some other monster down there to deal with. Yagra then retreated to a different area of the taproom, her usual hangout, and started to tend her own wounds. 

As conversation and a hesitant feeling of normalcy returned to the room, a man walked across traffic to approach you. He introduced himself as "[Volothamp Geddarm](heist/waterdeep/npcs/volothamp-geddarm.md), chronicler, wizard, and celebrity". After praising your Valor, he begged for your help in finding his friend, [Floon Blagmaar](heist/waterdeep/npcs/floon-blagmaar.md), who has been missing for two days. After gathering gold coins and any additional information you could, Volo excused himself with thanks.

## Housekeeping
- Finalize Rowen's details & origin in the city
- How old is Rowen? Where did Nibbles come from

## Adventure begins.. 
![](../days/1499-03-27-ches.md#^weather)

- [Where to start](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#wdh,2,where%20to%20start)

```ad-scene
The Yawning Portal is a famous inn and tavern located in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep. 
 
The place is a stone building with a slate roof and several chimneys. Most of the ground floor is taken up by the tavern's common room, which contains a 40-foot-diameter open well (actually the outer shell of a sunken stone tower) that descends 140 feet to the first level of Undermountain, the sprawling dungeon under Waterdeep.
 
A rope-and-pulley mechanism is used to lower adventurers into the well and hoist them out. 
```

We talked about this: Rowen comes to the Yawning Portal at the end of the day. To have dinner, catch up with ["Threestrings" ](heist/waterdeep/npcs/threestrings-mattrim-mereg.md), and try to grab new work for the next day.

Rowen is remarkable (as a bird-person.. not unheard of, but not common either. There are also Kenku around...). Rown has earned some recognition for being reliable, and able to resolve some situations or run messages or deliver errands or whatever other thing needs doing that can be done for coin.

### Tavern Brawl

5 human thugs (leader has tatooed head) jumped [Yagra Stonefist](heist/waterdeep/npcs/yagra-stonefist.md) just as Rowen entered the tavern for his usual dinner and drink with [Threestrings](heist/waterdeep/npcs/threestrings-mattrim-mereg.md).

```ad-scene
Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: "Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?" Then a seven-foot-tall half-orc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump into the fray. The half-orc cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure-but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?
```

#### What happened

Rowen tried to create a distraction to break up the fight, and while he succeeded in catching the attention of some of the patrons, it wasn't enough. Yagra knocked their leader (Krentz) unconscious, his followers then knocked her unconscious, and then [Durnan](heist/waterdeep/npcs/durnan.md) chased them all out of the tavern with a well-thrown dagger and some choice words (they snagged their unconscious leader and fled).

Rowen went over to check on Yagra and make sure she was ok (just unconscious). A spare few moments passed before a Troll climbed up out of the portal and into the taproom. It had 6 stirges gorging themselves on it, and 3 more hovering ...

Durnan grabbed his greatsword and lunged at the troll, giving the rest (mainly Rowen and Threestrings, everyone else had vanished) instructions to take down the stirges and get lamp oil and fire ready for when the troll falls. He then focused all of his attention on the troll, which forced the troll to remain focused on him, in turn. 

Rowen killed two of the stirges, and Threestrings killed the other. Rowen also then managed to hack down the lantern-hearing chandelier hanging over the troll's head. It crashed down, killing the troll AND dousing it in oil... Durnan made a quick grab for the nearest lantern to light the oil (and the troll) on fire.

Threestrings brought Yarga back to consciousness, and she helped Durnan get the (still on fire) Troll over the edge and back down into the depths.

Threestrings then sat back down by the fire, and started playing "everything is fine" music to get everyone to settle down and come out. Rowen sat down next to him, and you made idle conversation while recovering from .. all of the events.

### Meeting Volo

 Volo pushed against the tide of patrons to approach Rowen and Threestrings, praising both for their bravery. Threestrings was very deliberately avoiding any conversation, becoming immersed in his music.

 Volo did take the hint, and directed all of his inquiries at Rowen.

 ```ad-scene
The figure who approached you strokes his mustache, adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. "Volothamp Geddarm, chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. I trust you've noted the violence in our fair city these past tendays. I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur's Gate! But now I fear I have misplaced a friend amid this odious malevolence.

"My friend's name is Floon Blagmaar. He's got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped-or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour of need?"
 ```

Volo gives Rowen a small pouch containing 10 dragons simply for accepting his quest. 

```ad-skill
title: DC 10 Insight check
collapse: closed
On a success, a character discerns that Volo is honest but might be stretching the truth about how much he can pay. 

Currently low on cash, Volo is awaiting royalty payments from *Volo's Guide to Monsters*. To make more coin, he began work on a new book, *Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters*. As it happens, his knowledge of spirits mostly concerns the alcoholic variety, and the **writing has not been going well**.

If pressed, Volo urges Rowen trust him, and promises he'll have the rest of the reward, 100 gp per participant, ready to deliver once Floon is returned to him alive.
```


Volo describes Floon as a *handsome human male in his early thirties* with *wavy red-blond hair*. 
- He was dressed in *princely garb* when Volo last saw him. 
- Two nights ago, before Floon disappeared, he and Volo were drinking and merrymaking at the *Skewered Dragon*, a dark, bawdy tavern in the *Dock Ward*. 

Volo is embarrassed to admit he might have gotten his friend Floon in trouble, and he resists providing all the details of what happened the night Floon disappeared:
- Beset by writer's block, Volo met Floon Blagmaar for drinks at the Skewered Dragon two nights ago. 
- They drank and gambled for a few hours, and then Volo left. 
- That's the last he saw of Floon.
