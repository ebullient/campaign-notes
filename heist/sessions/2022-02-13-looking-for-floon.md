## Summary

### Yagra at the Yawning Portal

Rowen asked Yagra a few questions, and learned about the Xanathar Guild, and that something bad has happened with the Xanathar Guild. 

Before heading to the Dock Ward, Rowen flew to his home, a small loft-style apartment above a bakery on an alley off of Slipstone Street. He changed clothes, into something more appropriate for the Dock Ward, and then flew from there to Helm's Hall. 

He crossed The Way of the Dragon to enter the Dock Ward, and saw a commotion about a block north. On inspection, he saw the aftermath of a deadly street fight. Three men were being arrested, all with winged snake tattoos visible in different places on their bodies. He was shooed away by the guards, and made his way south for a few blocks so he could enter the Dock Ward proper via Fillet Lane. 

### The Skewered Dragon
Rowen found The Skewered Dragon, a dilapidated Tavern that opened onto the alley. He walked into a semi-unfriendly environment, with dock workers huddled over their ale after a long day of work. They didn't seem particularly receptive to strangers. 

Rowen made his lute just the right bit of off-key, and began playing sea shanties and lullabies that he learned growing up in the orphanage. The selection was perfect. Shoulders and faces relaxed, a few smiles came out. Passerby on the road floated in. Berca soon had a much bigger early evening crowd than usual, and all were behaving well.

Berca let Rowen know (given how much additional coin came into the tavern, along with the shift in mood) that Volo had indeed been present the other night, with a friend. That friend stayed after Volo left, and was joined by... another noble. One that she knew, and didn't like. Given the amount of gold and goodwill earned, Berca did share that the other man was Lord Renear Neverember, the old Open Lord's son. It was clear that she did not think much of him, however. Berca mentioned that she missed when the two men left, one of her regular patrons needed help getting home just then. But Narth (she pointed across the room to a gnarled man with dice next to him), Narth was playing with them that night, he might know.

[Narth Sigurd](../waterdeep/npcs/narth-sigurd.md) was an old (but still active/fit) dock worker. He warmed up to Rowen soon enough, and went into a long ramble about jewlery (the person who was with Volo was wearing a blue pearl necklace with a unicorn charm). On reflection, he realized that both of the "lordlings" were careful with their play, staying well within the means of the people they were playing with, which he found somewhat unexpected. He also observed (in a surprised way), that the lordling he was strongly inclined to dislike suggested he walk his friend home (as he'd had quite a bit to drink by that time). Somewhere between 5-7 people followed them out. It hadn't really registered at the time. Yes, they did leave at the same time, but they may have been guards.. only now that Rowen is asking, he suspects that they weren't. He also thinks he saw a winged snake tattoo on one of their necks? 

Narth was struggling to remember any more, but had the sudden realization that "that purple monstrosity of a store" is usually open late at night, and so the owner might know something about what happened. Rowen chatted with Narth until he noticed dice players inbound (not too much longer), at then took his leave with a kind farewell.

## Recap of Last Session
![2022-02-06-the-adventure-begins.md](2022-02-06-the-adventure-begins.md#Summary)

## Create a strong start
![](../days/1499-03-27-ches.md#^weather)

```ad-scene
We begin in the Yawning Portal. You're sitting sitting next to Threestrings, who is concentrating on playing his slightly off-key three stringed lute. Volo is walking away. Durnan is back behind the bar, and [Yagra](/faerûn/npcs/waterdeep/yagra-stonefist.md) is sitting by herself at her own table across the room.

As you watch Volo depart, something he said in passing clicked with othr things in your mind. He said something about "the recent violence in the city". And now that you think about it, it *has* been more violent.. maybe over the past two, or maybe three, ten days. Tussels always happen, but it seems like more are occurring out in the open than is typical. You look over at Yagra. You know that she is a mercenary, and a body guard, and that she has been in more than her fair share of fights of all kinds, and wonder what set this one off.
```

## Potential Scenes

- [x] **Talk to Yagra**

```ad-scene
title: Talk to Yagra
collapse: closed

*Who jumped her?* 
> You saw them, did you? They were Xanathar Guild thugs. Those folk can't seem help covering themselves with tattoos or markings of eyes. It's the weirdest thing. Why would you shout to the hilltops that you're a member of the unofficial crime guild in the city? It doesn't make any sense if you ask me.

*Why did they attack?* 
> Because they are boneheads and thought they could take me?

She looks at you for a moment, and adds, quietly, 

> "I will share with you, Rowen, despite the tiny monster you carry in your pocket who I swear will someday make an excellent snack, my feeling that something has gone sideways. You know I am a mercenary. Davil, whom I guard, is a negotiator of some kind. I don't know the details of what he was trying to do with the Xanathar Guild, but something else has happened. He checked on me when I came over here. He didn't say much, but I could tell he is as mystified as I am."
```

- [x] **Blood in the Streets**

```ad-scene
title: A Brawl gone bad
collapse: closed

As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the City Watch. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Watch officers have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst of questioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. "Get on," she says. "Nothing to see here."


Something catches your attention, and you take one more look at the men being arrested as you turn to go: *each of them has a black tattoo of a flying snake*. You spotted the first tattoo on a neck, as the man shrugged his shoulders and rolled his head. You spotted another on the back of a hand, as one of the guards grabbed the attached arm to put in manacles. The third man had it on his forearm.. plainly visible due to a torn sleeve.
```

- [x] **Enter the Dock Ward**

```ad-scene
title: The Dock Ward
collapse: closed

Tall, densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level. Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed and their candles stolen, and the smells of salt air and excrement linger as you pass by rows of run-down buildings.
```

- [x] **Question Patrons at the Skewered Dragon**

````ad-scene
title: The Skewered Dragon
collapse: closed

The dock workers are slumped over their cups and somewhat sullen. Not the friendliest bunch.

```ad-skill
title: A bribe or DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check

- Volo was here with a friend
- The friend was wearing a gaudy necklace of blue pearls with a unicorn’s head charm.
- Another Noble came in after Volo left. "Chip off the old block, that one!" sneers one patron. "Just another spoiled, rich noble who likes to rub our noses in it!"
- The two drank and played a few rounds of Three-Dragon Ante before leaving around midnight. Several men, one of whom had a *tattoo of a flying black snake on his neck*, followed them out. That's all they know.
- Note: Berca, the bartender, knows that the other man was Renaer Neverember, the son of Waterdeep’s previous Open Lord, Dagult Neverember, but she won’t be free with that information.
