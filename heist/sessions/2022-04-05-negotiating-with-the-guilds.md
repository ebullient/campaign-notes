## Summary

Coral and Rowen spent the next few hours clearing debris from the taproom. They had a few scares, as they looked up at the last minute to dodge a stream of debris flowing out the door and into the carts on their own.

Another cart pulled into the alley around Tharson. Varkel got as close to the manor as he could given the other two carts, and he and the sisters and Rowen and Coral all worked together to transfer its contents into the tavern: two tables that were sturdy enough but had seen better days; twelve place settings (mis-matched sturdy chair, plate, wooden tankard, napkin, knife, spoon, fork); two brooms, a dustpan, a mop and bucket; and a good armload of rags of all shapes and sizes.

By the time the sisters got themselves organized and the mop bucket filled, one of the brooms was happily (and neatly) moving itself, creating a tidy pile of dirt near the door. Nora and Euphemia rolled up their sleeves, donned some working aprons, and set to cleaning all of the taproom surfaces with a will. Trym focused on the bar and the new tables, fussing over how the chairs and tables were positioned, and artfully arranging two small kegs of beer, a few bottles of wine, a pitcher of water, various covered plates, a cornucopia of fruit and bread, and other finger foods.

The trickle of guild members arrived in singles and pairs starting at Tharsun. [Broxley Fairkettle](heist/waterdeep/npcs/broxley-fairkettle.md) arrived first; Lidda was right, he was the representative for the Fellowship of Innkeepers in the North Ward, and was thrilled to know that someone was looking at reopening the place, as he'd long believed it was haunted. His eyes got very very big as a glass of wine poured itself without a drip, steadily hovered across the floor, and set itself next to him on the table. Lidda grinned at him. "We're pretty sure it's haunted, too, and we think it's wonderful." 

The Cellarar's and Plumber's Guild, Surveyors', Map-, and Chart-makers' Guild, and the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild arrived at somewhat overlapping times. The proposed floor plans were reviewed, schedules were made, and inspection checkpoints set. The Bakers' Guild, the Guild of Butchers, and the Vintners', Distillers', and Brewers' Guild arrived after that, and plans were made for initial delivery of supplies on Tarsahk 4.

Between Trym and Lif (the poltergeist), no throat remained parched and no liquid was spilled. The vittles were eaten, arrangements made, and by the evening's end, as the last guild representative departed, everyone looked at everyone else with slow satisfied grins plastered on their tired faces. "Not bad," said Lidda. "Not bad at all," agreed Euphemia. Everyone pitched in again to make sure everything was properly cleared and put away.

The sisters took their leave to head back to Brandarthall. When Coral and Rowen closed the taproom to head up to the manor house to sleep, their last glance through the door included a mop and bucket making a final slow pass across the floor.

*Long Rest*
