# Session on 2022-05-08: The Passive Fist
<span class="nav">[‚Üê previous](2022-05-01-doppelgangers-and-disguises.md) ~ ‚ù¶ ~ [next ‚Üí](2022-05-15-neighbors.md)</span>

## Summary
After the usual gathering for morning breakfast in the taproom, Rowen and Nora left the manor house to head to the Southern Ward.

<span class='ob-timelines' data-category='heist' data-date='1499-Tarsakh-03-01' data-name="ü™ï Coral meets other Genasi"></span>

Just after they left, Avi and Embric, the owners of Steam and Steel, arrived, bearing a mix of mirrored wall sconces and lanterns that Lidda had ordered from them. Lif helped hold one aloft, so they could see how far apart they should be spaced to provide sufficient light. 

While the Kettlewhistles, Lif and the genasi craftsman fussed around with the lanterns, a half-elf arrived carring covered bundle that turned out to be a meticulously carved tavern sign. Tally introduced himself to Coral, and after Lidda came over to admire and approve the workmanship, he excused himself rather quickly, with a promise to return some other time.

Avi asked how well the Kettlewhistles and Coral were aquainted with Embric. After a somewhat heated and frustrated exchange with Avi, Embric stormed off. Avi explained that they were trying to reach a business arragement with Tally (to their mutual benefit), but something happened over dinner one night. Tally excused himself rather hastily (before having any cake!), and has avoided them since. Embric assumes it is an issue with their (Avi/Embric) relationship, but Avi doesn't think so. He doesn't know what the problem is, exactly, and would love it if someone could find out.

Coral asked Avi about their plans for Goldenight, and they threw together a loose plan: Avi and Embric would bring some of their smaller wares to the tavern, as that was easily visible / accessible from the main road for goldenight.

As Coral and the Kettlewhistles talked with the neighbors and began work on the Taproom and the Manor house for the day, Nora and Rowen reached the Southern Ward. Nora took Rowen on a slight detour past the Saddlers' and Harness Makers' Guildhall to *The Singing Kettle*, her parents' Inn. Both Nora and Rowen were interviewed by the keen force that was Nora's mother (she was obviously a Salibuck, though she did not have the chin dimple). After thorough questioning and mutual assurance, Nora and Rowen made their escape and returned to the Guildhall, where Osswald Bohm helped Nora and Rowen with their flying gear. 

In the end, Rowen ended up with some additional d-rings securely attached to the studded leather armor he already wore. Nora had a harness that looked somewhat like a climber's harness, with some other clips and loops available to help her control her body position on Rowen's back.

They quickly headed from there to the lower southern slope of Mount Waterdeep. While their first takeoff and landing was a little awkward, Nora proved adept at making herself very small against Rowen's back, and in being able to ensure that her weight shifted with Rowen rather than against him, so that she didn't throw him off balance.  Rowen took off again, this time with more confidence that he wasn't going to frighten Nora, and it was brilliant. They zoomed over the harbor, catching a glimpse of two shapes swimming in the water... one that was huge (obviously a shark) and another that was .. something else. Rowen then glided over and landed near the entrance to Hlam's cave.

It took awhile to reach the cave. The tunnel seemed to go on and on... and when they reached it, they found a large, round, empty chamber, with a meditating man sitting criss-cross in the center facing them. Nora introduced herself to him, and challenged him to a spar. She tried every trick she knew, landed a few hits, and resisted several of his maneuvers, which impressed Hlam quite a bit. So much so, that he gave them two bits of information, rather than just one:

- Xanathar: "Evil grows more paranoid and less patient daily. They will strike before *summer* starts."
- Manshoon : "Evil's twin hides its face for now. Expect that to change before *winter*'s end."

After taking their leave from Hlam, they went directly to Blackstaff Tower to share the result with Vajra (who revealed the rarity of Hlam sharing so much).  Vajra knew immediately that the first applied to The Xanathar, and while the source was known, the nearness of some kind of activity was not.. so this was good to know. The other, she wasn't sure. Rowen shared what Mirt had mentioned: about how some of the Zhenterim behavior seemed a throwback.. to what the Zhenterim used to be in days long gone. Vajra thought it unlikely, but said she would mention it to Laeral when next they met, to see what she thought (as another who has fought Manshoon before).

After speaking with Vajra, Rowen and Nora stopped at Rowen's old apartment and cleared it out. The manor house was secure enough to move what little Rowen owned into the new space, even if things were only tucked away in storage cubbies waiting for proper furniture.
