# Magisters
<span class="subhead">Judicial enforcers of Waterdeep</span>

Crimes and their corresponding sentences, as administered by the Lords and Magisters of Waterdeep. Waterdeep has two levels to its legal system: The Magisters and The Lord's Court. 

There are 26 magisters, or "black-robes", in the city, and they may normally be found either at the Palace (3 at all times) or the city gates (1 during daylight hours). 

They have the duty of running the courts and issuing sentences to those that were found guilty. The Black Robes are each protected by at least six members of the City Guard while traveling the streets of Waterdeep.

Magisterial justice may be appealed to the Lords by anyone, but such appeals must be within nine days of the initial sentencing, and non-citizens of Waterdeep must persuade a citizen of the City to appeal on their behalf. Appeals face strict punishment if claims are ruled as frivolous.

Magisters sometimes order confinement (and to a busy merchant, imprisonment may result in a far greater loss of income than the fine that goes with it). After two days of confinement, prisoners are always brought before the Lords, and examined by a physician before them.
