## Membership

To join a guild, one must possess a background, a proficiency, or a status that the guild values. 
For example, a character with the sailor background is welcome to join the Master Mariners' Guild. 

One can practice a profession and not be a guild member, but such autonomy carries a cost. The guilds do everything they can to entice new members to join and pay for membership, and they go out of their way to hinder independent business owners, up to and including driving them out of business.   

A baker who refuses to join the Bakers' Guild might find her flour supply cut off, while a wizard who refuses to join the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors might be denied access to sages, libraries, and other useful resources.

## Guilds

### Baker's Guild
An organization of united, skilled bakers headquartered in the *Master Bakers' Hall*,  on the Street of the Sword in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep.

They were an extremely wealthy and influential guild that was renowned for the high-quality goods they produced. 

The guild produced tasty breads and pastries that formed the majority of many Waterdhavians' diets, and hired dedicated "runners" to ensure their orders were safely delivered to their intended destinations. 

Guild membership cost 10 gp, with an annual fee of 5 sp per month. Entrance into the guild has to be approved upon application by the Master and the "Master Bakers" (the ten most-senior members of the guild).

### Carpenters', Roofers' and Plasterers' Guild
An organized group of surveyors, engineers, skilled craftspeople, and workers who conducted the business of building construction, repair, and maintenance in the city of Waterdeep and throughout the Sword Coast. 

They are kept constantly busy by the high demand for their work.

Guild work is rather expensive. For every day on the job, the guild charged 1 gp per worker, 5 gp for a surveyor-chartist, 5 gp for an engineer, 10 gp for "crew needs", such as food and drink, along with the cost of materials.

They are headquartered in *The Stone House*, located on Telshambra's Street in the Southern Ward

###  Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild
The guild was employed to dig foundations and maintain the city's sewer system. They kept the sewers well-maintained.  They used secret recipes to perform their maintenance duties and ordered their materials from others rather than making them themselves

### Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers
The Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers was a guild in Waterdeep catering to entertainers and those who fashioned musical instruments. Commonly known as just *the Musician's Guild*, it is one of the more prominent guilds of the city.

Although a significant number of non-guild entertainers (including amateurs and travelling bards and shows) worked in Waterdeep, and did so freely, the Council took the greatest slice of the professional entertainment industry for the city and upper classes. *An entertainer seeking to earn real coin needs guild membership to reach wealthy patrons and clients.*

Guild members had a reputation for quality, and thus could charge high fees for their services: a performer typically charged 6 gp a day, while an instrument-maker charged on average 1 gp a day for however many days it took to craft a custom instrument.

Guild membership cost 30 gp, with annual dues of 25 gp for full members and 15 gp for apprentices. To become a full member, one had to be considered a skilled and accomplished artisan in their field.

The Council has their headquarters in the *House of Song*, located along Rivon Street in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.

### Fellowship of Bowers and Fletchers

The fellowship regularly accepted new members for an entrance fee of 5 gp. Their regular dues were a monthly fee of 8 sp.

Their guildhall, the *Citadel of the Arrow*, is located along Burnt Wagon Way in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.

### Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen
...


### The Fellowship of Innkeepers
The fellowship collectively bargained for products they all used, such as drink, linens, and laundering services, to acquire them at a discount for their respective establishments. They also shared their funds to hire a band of well-armed guards whose services would otherwise be well beyond their budgets.

Every nine nights, the guildmaster opened up Fellowship Hall for its members, so they could enjoy the luxuries of staying in a quality inn for a change.

Entrance into the fellowship had to be approved by a majority of the existing guild members and cost 25 gp. Annual dues were 20 gp.

### Guild of Apothecaries and Physicians

Their headquarters is the *House of Healing*, which is on the High Road between Tarnath and Suldown Streets.

### Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters
A group of organized, professional candle-makers and lamplighters who operated within the city of Waterdeep. The group is employed by the city to keep city lamps lit at night.

During the day, members of the guild spent their time maintaining or fixing lamps and producing tallow candles, which they then offered for sale. At night they used their glow pots and reach poles to light the lamps and lampposts located throughout the city. While they had an official contract with city officials, they also performed this service for the city's nobles and wealthier citizens. 

Their guildhall is the *House of Light*, a constantly bright row house in the Trades Ward, which is noted for the mountainous heap of waxed candles that is kept lit outside the building at all hours. It is one of the brightest spots in the ward at night, and is easily found by the smell of lemony-scented wax.

### Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters
...

### Guild of Watermen
The Guild of Watermen was a group of Waterdhavian dockmen and sailors that kept Deepwater Harbor clean and free from debris and ferried goods from ships moored to the dock. Due to the amount of ships coming in and out of Waterdeep's port, their duties had them working round-the-clock. Fortunately, the importance of their labors was well-known.

The [Watermens' Hall](../places/watermens-hall.md) is located along Dock Street, in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep. The guild uses this as a warehouse for members to store their ferries and skiffs as well as any and all things found while trying to keep Deepwater Harbor clean.

### Jewelers' Guild
The Jewelers' Guild is responsible for the acquisition and distribution of gems throughout the city, as well as the cutting, mounting, and appraisal of gemstones. It is small, secretive, and extremely wealthy.

The guild also provides exchange of currency to and from Waterdhavian-minted coins, at guild-standard rates. Together with the [Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters](#Guild%20of%20Trusted%20Pewterers%20and%20Casters), they were known for having the most accurate scales.

The guild's headquarters is the *House of Gems*, located on the north side of Gem Street in the Castle Ward.

### Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths and Metalforgers
The guild imported and provided its members with the raw materials needed for their crafts. They also made the tools that their members required for their work, either renting or selling them, while ensuring they remained well-maintained.

Guildmembers were always busy, crafting everyday metal objects, such as *brackets, chains, hinges, horseshoes, latches, needles, and the like*. They were also responsible for crafting simple weapons such as *hammers and maces*. 

In business, the guild prided themselves in being able to design efficient, yet elegant items; produce items quickly; and, when required, replicate those designs with exacting precision.
