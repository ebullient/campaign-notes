# Force Grey
<span class="subhead">Specialized Adventuring Force, Waterdeep</span>

Force Grey is an elite cadre of specialized adventurers, drawn from the ranks of the Gray Hands, whose fighting prowess is matched only by their loyalty to the city. Force Grey attracts the best of the best. 

Whenever Waterdeep has a problem that can't be handled by diplomats or the city's other armed forces, the Open Lord has the option to mobilize Force Grey. Such action is usually taken as a last resort, since some past members of the group have exhibited a tendency to indulge in wanton violence, causing as much damage as they ostensibly prevent.

Although the Open Lord sets mission goals and parameters whenever the unit is activated, the Force Grey team needed to complete any given assignment is made up of individuals handpicked by the Blackstaff.

If members of Force Grey (and, in some cases, the Gray Hands) are arrested for a crime, the Open Lord or the Blackstaff will usually intervene on their behalf and facilitate their release.

## Joining Force Gray
To join Force Grey, one must first become a member of the Gray Hands. 

An individual who has served in the City Watch or the City Guard is eligible to join, as are characters who are willing to swear oaths to defend Waterdeep, its citizens, and its laws with their lives. 

Adventurers who show promise might be invited to join the [Gray Hands](gray-hands.md), a faction overseen by the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr. Members of the Gray Hands complete assignments dictated by Vajra. 

| Rank                        | Renown |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Gray Hand Initiate          | 1 |
| Junior Gray Hand            | 3 |
| Senior Gray Hand            | 10 | 
| Force Grey Initiate         | 25 |
| Defender of Waterdeep       | 50 |

Force Grey support comes in these ways:

- Adventurers who are arrested are released under the loose supervision of [Vajra Safahr](../npcs/vajra-safahr.md)
- The adventurers receive a helpful uncommon or rare magic item that they're allowed to use for a time (until it mysteriously disappears).
- [Meloon Wardragon](../npcs/meloon-wardragon.md) or some other respected member of Force Grey helps the adventurers out of a tough situation.
