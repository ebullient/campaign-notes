# Elyellas Greycastle
<span class="subhead">[Path of Crumbs](../places/path-of-crumbs.md), Trollskull Alley, North Ward of Waterdeep</span>

Elyellas is a small Half-Elf, his hair is short and brown, his eyes are blue. He has a small frame and is very nimble. He wears a brown apron with the logo of his bakery, a round dish with a crust of bread, and a trail of crumbs leading to the lower right.

He is friendly, and greets patrons with a warm smile and offer them a free loaf of bread if he hasn't seen them before. He is very chatty and loves talking about his bakery, and how he's the only one in town who can bake a mean loaf of bread. 

**Moods**: companionable, abandoned, disappointed, electrified
