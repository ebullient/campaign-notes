# Eldon Highhill
<span class="subhead">[Sew and Tell](../places/sew-and-tell.md), Trades Ward of Waterdeep</span>

Eldon is a dependable innocent.  He frequently uses the wrong words, and notices only half the time.

He has a characteristic patch of pure white hair above his left temple, the rest is a rich reddish brown.

## Details

He earns enough to be comfortable.

He can drink all of his friends under the table.

## Relationships
He is a long-time friend of Rowen and Coral. They helped him find a very special lost thimble a few years ago. Someone knicked it from the cabinet and he was so distraught. Rowen didn't even charge him a fee, as the task was minor, but Eldon was so appreciative that he helped Rowen and Coral understand disguises. He makes sure all of Rowen's armor and clothing fits properly (taking into account flight).

## Secrets

He has a secret desire to become a famous fashion designer, but the idea of that much attention and glamor is also terrifying, so he keeps things simple.
