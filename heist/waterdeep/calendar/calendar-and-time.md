![hours-of-the-day](heist/waterdeep/assets/hours-of-the-day.png#callout)

The Faerunian day is 24 hours long, broken up by the rising and setting sun. 

- **Godswake:** predawn
- ***Dawn***
- **Harbright:** full morning
- **Elsun:** late morning
- ***Highsun*** noon
- **Thulsun:** early afternoon
- **Tharsun:** late afternoon
    - sometimes called "highthar" by merchants, after the traditional meal break at that time of day. Sometimes also called "longride."
- ***Lastride*** dusk
- **Eventide:** gloaming, pre-evening
    - still light out, though the sun has set or is setting
- **Eldark:** full night, but before midnight
    - considered the "civilized" or social time of night
- ***Deepnight*** midnight
- **Thuldark:** the night between midnight and godswake
    - considered the "unseemly" time of night, for intrigues, assignation, and revelry gone far too long.
