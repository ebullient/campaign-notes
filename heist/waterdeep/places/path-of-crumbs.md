# Path of Crumbs
<span class="subhead">Bakery, Trollskull Alley, North Ward of Waterdeep</span>

The sign above the door is wooden. There are no words, but the carving and paint clearly show a plate with half-eaten bread, and a trail of crumbs pointing toward the shop's door.

The shop is a two-story timber and brick building, with tall elf-wrought wooden shelves. The air is warm.

- **Owner** [Elyellas](../npcs/elyellas-graycastle.md)
- **Location** Delzorin Street, near the south entrance to Trollskull Alley
