# Zephyr Post
<span class="subhead">Post station, North Ward of Waterdeep</span>

Birds of all colors can be seen delivering letters through the upper windows of this sky-blue townhouse at all hours of the day. 

The residents of Trollskull Alley and other nearby streets use the Zephyr Post to deliver letters to friends, colleagues, and mercenaries throughout Waterdeep. 

The inside of the shop is filled with the sweet aroma of Calishite incense.

- **Location** Delzorin Street, North Ward of Waterdeep

## Services

The Zephyr Post’s birds can deliver a message to any address in Waterdeep for 2 sp. 

### Hirelings
Additionally, mercenaries and other hirelings can be contracted through the Zephyr Post. By sending a bird and attaching their fee in advance, a hireling will arrive at the characters’ residence the next morning.
