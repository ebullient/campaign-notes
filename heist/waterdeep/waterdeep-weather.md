# Waterdeep Weather

The City of Splendors enjoys milder weather than the norm due to unusually warm ocean currents and shelter from northern storms by Mount Waterdeep. Despite these advantages, strong westerly winds often beset the city, making it a damp and misty place.

## Random Weather Tables

While some encounters require specific weather conditions as part of their story, the weather is frequently overlooked. Use this appendix to generate random weather effects to give life to your encounters. Based on the season, roll a d20 to determine the current weather.

All temperatures are given in Fahrenheit.

### Winter

Winters in Waterdeep often range from 0 to 45 degrees and snow is not uncommon. The warm westerly winds frequently lead to melting snow which only adds to foggy conditions. Snow from bitter northern winds is generally preferred by most locals, as a frozen road is easier to traverse than a muddy one.

### Spring

Spring is a season of frequent rains, punctuated by more frequent fog. Thought by many to be the least pleasant season in the city, late spring rarely sees cold weather and is quite agreeable. With temperatures ranging from 30 to 85 degrees, it sees the most variation of any season.

### Summer

Summer in Waterdeep finds its heat moderated by ocean winds. While rain is still commonplace, it is less frequent during the midday. Temperatures often range from 60 to 90 degrees with the occasional thunderstorm blowing in out of the northwest.

### Autumn

Like spring, weather in the fall varies significantly, but it is generally more temperate on average. Rain and storms are common, but so are sunny days. Temperatures range from 35 to 90 degrees.

## Weather Effects

Each result on the Random Weather Tables possesses one or more of the following weather effects.

### Cold

The temperature ranges between 0 and 32 degrees. This functions as Extreme Cold, except the *saving throw is made with advantage*.

### Extreme Cold

This functions as Extreme Cold from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide: 

> Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.

### Hail

Hailstones plummet from the sky, causing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. 

Creatures caught without shelter for ten minutes or more must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1d3 bludgeoning damage.

### Heavy Fog

A blanket of heavy fog makes it impossible to see across the street. The entire area is heavily obscured, and creatures suffer from the blindness condition when attempting to see anything beyond five feet of them.

###  Heavy Precipitation

> Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in the area have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

Heavy Precipitation from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide

### Heavy Rain or Snow

As [Heavy Precipitation](waterdeep-weather.md#Heavy%20Precipitation). 

If it has been snowing for an hour or more, exterior locations in the city count as difficult terrain. 

### Hot 

The temperature ranges between 85 and 100 degrees. 

Characters without shelter or water suffer effects as per Extreme Heat from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, except their *saving throws are made with advantage*.

> When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.
> 
> Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.

### Ice

As Slippery Ice from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

> Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.

### Light Fog

A light fog lightly obscures the area, causing Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight to be made with disadvantage.

### Lightning

Extreme weather has generated perfect conditions for lightning strikes. For every ten minutes that a creature spends in the open, it has a cumulative 2% chance of being caught in a lightning strike. 

A creature struck by lightning must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, suffering 18 (4d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Characters wearing metal armor or in high places such as roof or treetops suffer disadvantage on this saving throw.

### Light Rain or Snow

A steady light precipitation covers the area, providing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Light rain has a 50% chance per hour of extinguishing an open flame. 

### Strong Wind

As Strong Wind from Chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

> A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.
> 
> A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Windy

Howling winds gust through the streets, providing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. Open flames have a 50% chance of being extinguished for every 10 minutes they’re exposed to the wind, and fog effects are automatically dispersed.
