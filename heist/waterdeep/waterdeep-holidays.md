# Waterdeep Holidays
Source: https://oakthorne.net/wiki/index.php?title=Waterdhavian_Social_Season

## Winter

<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Hammer-01-00' data-name='ðŸ—“ Wintershield'></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Alturiak-14-00' data-name='ðŸ—“ The Grand Revel'></span>

The fierce Northern winters essentially shut the city down. As of the first blizzard, snow usually lies thick on the ground, and cruelly cold winds rush in off the ocean to lock the city down.

Most nobles flee the city entirely during the winter, preferring to lock down their opulent villas in favor of country properties that are much cozier, or even for holdings in warmer, more southerly lands (most families of Tethyrian blood maintain houses in Amn, Tethyr and Calimshan, as well).

As a result, while the Guild of Street Laborers works diligently to keep most of the streets of the city snow-free, the Sea and North Wards are basically left to snow-over (with the exception of the High Road and major roads).

***Fleetswake (Ches 21 - 30):*** Generally speaking, the Spring Social Season begins with Fleetswake, when winter has let up enough to allow ships to return to the Waterdhavian harbor. Many noble families return during this week, taking rooms in inns while their servants prepare their estates for reinhabiting. 

![Ches 21-30 Fleetswake](compendium/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/11-volos-waterdeep-enchiridion/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#Ches%2021-30%20Fleetswake)

***Shipwrights' Ball (Ches 25):***  Annual, held at the **Shipwrights' House** on the corner of Dock Street and Asteril's Way. 

***Fair Seas Festival (Ches 29 - 30):***  Much feasting on seafood, the harbor is strewn with flower petals, and the City Guards go from tavern to tavern to collect offerings for [Umberlee](/compendium/deities/faerunian-umberlee.md). Collection boxes also appear at large festival gatherings. Upon sunset of the final day, the collected coin is placed in chests and dumped into the deepest part of the harbor.

***Highcoin Balls (Ches 30):***  When Lord Peirgeiron was High Lord of Waterdeep, he threw the Highcoin Ball on the 30th of Ches which would last all through the last day of the Fair Seas Festival. It was considered the absolute necessity for those intending to be on the scene that season, and those who missed it became an afterthought for the rest of the year. After Lord Peirgeionâ€™s passing, a number of noble families tried to pick up the tradition. The result are *the Highcoin Balls*, which generally begin after sundown (when the ceremonies of Umberleeâ€™s Cache take place). Itâ€™s not unusual for guests to wander from one party to the next.

### Tarsakh

### Greengrass (Festival)

<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Greengrass-01-00'  data-name='ðŸ—“ Greengrass tastings'></span>

Wreaths of fresh flowers - some wider across than a man is tall - adorn the front gates of noble villas at Greengrass. Though a few do enjoy pilgrimages to celebrate the holiday in the hedonistic revel known as the Lady's Revels at the nearby Chauntean abbey of the Goldenfields, the nobles of Waterdeep tend not to do too much on this day.

**The Greengrass Tastings:** The main exception to this rule is with those families who deal in wine. These families (the Amcathras, Ammakyls, Melshimbers, Rosznars and Thanns) often hold open-barrel tasting parties, where the coming year's vintages are tasted to see how they're coming along before being bottled and sold. These parties are as much about business as they are about pleasure, with the families inviting various masters of the [Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild](heist/waterdeep/groups/guilds-of-waterdeep.md#Vintners',%20Distillers',%20&%20Brewers'%20Guild), and various prestigious tavern- and inn-owners in attendance as well.

### Mirtul

<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Mirtul-04-00' data-name='ðŸ—“ The Presentation Ball'></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Mirtul-06-00' data-name='ðŸ—“ The Plowing and the Running begins'></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Mirtul-09-00' data-name='ðŸ—“ The Plowing and the Running ends'></span>

***The Presentation Ball (Mirtul 4):*** The height of the event is the Presentation, when young noble men and women - only now old enough this year to be considered "accepted" into society - step up one by one to be introduced to the Open Lord and two of the Masked Lords. Once that has been done, those nobles are considered "fair game" for politicking, courting and are in all other ways treated as adult members of their Houses.

The rest of the event consists of dancing, particularly with the newly-presented guests; more than one jaded noble has commented that the flurry that surrounds the newly-presented was uncomfortably reminiscent of the drooling excitement a pack of hounds finds in the introduction of fresh meat to their kennels.

***The Plowing and Running (Mirtul 6-9)***
![Mirtul 6-9 The Plowing and Running](compendium/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/11-volos-waterdeep-enchiridion/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#Mirtul%206-9%20The%20Plowing%20and%20Running)

## Summer

Summer is marked by a variety of important parties, balls and similar events. It is the time to be seen, and while it has the fewest traditional events, it is when each of the Houses try to make their mark on the season with a new theme, entertainment, patronage or other event that will set the tongues to wagging about them.

### Flamerule

<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Flamerule-01-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ Founders' Day"></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Flamerule-03-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ Sornyn begins"></span>

<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Flamerule-20-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ Theater season ends"></span>

***Founders' Day (Flamerule 1)***
![Flamerule 1 Founders' Day](compendium/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/11-volos-waterdeep-enchiridion/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#Flamerule%201%20Founders'%20Day)

***Founders' Day Viewing Parties (Flamerule 1):*** Some civic-minded nobles throw small parties in the very stands of the Field of Triumph, using their influence and coin to lay claim to one of the viewing boxes and inviting important city officials and other nobles to the festivities they host there. It's considered an old-fashioned event, however, even if the alliances created and influence garnered with various city officials makes it worth it.

***Sornyn (Flamerule 3-5)***
![Flamerule 3-5 Sornyn](compendium/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/11-volos-waterdeep-enchiridion/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#Flamerule%203-5%20Sornyn)

***Sornyn Ball (Flamerule 5):*** The end of the Waukeenar festival around treaties and envoys, this ball is thrown by Lord Peirgeiron as a welcome to the new diplomats to the city, and a welcome back to those who've been here for years. It is an opportunity for the noble Houses to get to know the ambassadors, and they do so with gusto, seeking the best possible opportunities for their families (and the city, of course).

***Llira's Night (Flamerule 7)***
![Flamerule 7 Lliira's Night](compendium/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/11-volos-waterdeep-enchiridion/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#Flamerule%207%20Lliira's%20Night)

***Theater Season (Flamerule 11 - 20):*** It is during this week that the myriad actors and performers unveil their latest works, hoping to earn an avid following among the nobles who expect the season's newest entertainments during this tenday. Theaters, festhalls, even courtyards in town all play host to bands of players. Among those who prefer to take their lovers from among actors and other players, this tenday is usually a time of excitement, courting and competitions among the nobles to be the one to win the affection of the popular new ingenue on the stage.

### Midsummer (Festival)

**Midsummer Ball:** The Midsummer Ball is an all-night affair that starts at dawn of Midsummer eve, and lasts until the dawn of the following day. This event is thrown in the Heroes' Garden, the Sea Ward park, and features an elevated dance floor, dozens of elaborate pavilions (sponsored by various Houses) with plenty of delicacies and ever-flowing drinks and music aplenty.

It is an evening originally intended to permit the sons and daughters of the nobility to meet one another under less-supervised circumstances, to dance and drink and flirt freely within the bounds of the outdoor Ball. In recent days, this has taken on a slightly more lascivious nature, where even those who aren't looking for a consort might take a fancy to someone they meet at the ball and spend some intimate time drinking and dancing with them.

### Shieldmeet (Festival)

<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Shieldmeet' data-name="ðŸ—“ Shieldmeet Council">Confirmation of Lords' Rule</span>

**Shieldmeet Ball:** Every Shieldmeet, Lord Piergeiron throws a grand ball for Waterdeep, with the interiors of the Palace laid open for nobles and the wealthy, and a grand festival air in the courtyard in front of the palace. Room within is limited, and the guests within are always influential and important, so the jockeying to achieve a place within is intense.

### Eleasias

<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Elesias-01-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ Ahghairon's Day">The Promenade of Violets</span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Elesias-17-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ The Annual Garden Parties begin (nobles)"></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Elesias-08-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ The Harbor Spectacles (nobles)"></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Elesias-17-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ The Annual Garden Parties end"></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Elesias-24-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ The Gathering of Harps begins"></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Elesias-24-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ The Gathering of Harps ends"></span>

**Divine Pageantry (early Eleasias):** Another event considered hopelessly old-fashioned by young, fashionable nobles, it is the only holy festival to Siamorphe, the goddess of nobility considered the patron of all Waterdhavian nobles. As such, no matter how de rigeur it is, the wise patron or matron of House ensures everyone in their family is there to take part, dressed in fine antique garments, spreading coin and remembering the proper old fashioned forms of address.

Many young nobles (and not a few elders) spend the weeks before the Pageantry going over the hoary old documents that detail every proper title, honorific and form of address for everyone they are likely to meet on that day. A gaffe in these stilted forms of address is not just a social blunder, but an act of blasphemy against the goddess of nobility.

***Ahghairon's Day (Eleasias 1)***
![Eleasis 1 Ahghairon's Day](compendium/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/11-volos-waterdeep-enchiridion/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#Eleasis%201%20Ahghairon's%20Day)

***The Promenade of Violets (Eleasias 1, Ahghairon's Day):*** A grand masquerade ball thrown by the House of Wonder in honor of one of the founders of Waterdeep, and the first of the Open Lords, the Promenade is held at the House of Wonder, the temple to Mystra, but organized and arranged by a small council of nobles chosen by the Temple Magister. This honor is usually bestowed on those families with some ties to wizardry themselves (meaning the Eltorchuls, Thunderstaves, and Wands families dominate), along with the head of the Magists' and Protectors Order, Mhair Szeltune. The ball is eagerly anticipated for its unprecedented spectacle, thanks to the magical talents of those who organize it.

***The Harbor Spectacles (Eleasias 8):*** At the height of summer, the nobility take to the waters. Various Houses fund massive party-boats, opulently decorated and provisioned, to invite guests onto. Usually built onto large barges, they often feature multiple decks of hedonistic entertainments.

These boats are launched with guests aboard, and are all arranged in a line so as to provide ample viewing opportunities to the slim five-man racing boats fielded by the various Houses. A purse of no small wealth is always offered the winner, and a great deal of betting goes on.

After the races, the true revels begin. The harbor becomes swarming with small ferry-boats going from party-boat to party-boat, allowing nobles to move from party to party, enjoying the variety. Of course, more betting goes on during this time as well, generally based on who the next drunk noble will be that manages to stumble and tip himself (and possibly his entire ferry-boat) into the cold waters of the harbor. Merfolk members of the Watch are usually in close patrol during these events, as are ten-man Watch boats.

***The Annual Garden Parties (Eleasias 17):*** Originating as Waukeenar Huldark celebrations, the annual garden parties of the Sea and North Ward are (like many things involving the nobles of Waterdeep) a fierce competition.

For months, noble families work to see that their gardens are the finest possible works of art. On the day of the party, each of the Houses involved throws a massive garden party, seeking to show off their gardens in the best possible light while also demonstrating the support of their peers.

A trio of judges travels from party to party, technically judging the quality of the garden, but also partaking of the merriment. These are usually personages of note, including clergy of the nature gods, previous years' winners and even Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun (a noted gardener in his own right) once or twice in the past.

By nightfall, a winner has been decided, and runners are dispatched to announce the victor at each of the ongoing parties, which usually results in a flood of guests abandoning the parties of losing Houses to essentially invade the party of the victors.

***The Gathering of Harps (Eleasias 24 - 28):*** An undertaking by several Houses concerned with music (notably Houses Crommor, Estelmer, Majarra, Melshimber and Thann), as well as the Council of Musiciant, Instrument Makers and Choristers, the Gathering is held at the Field of Triumph. It is a day full of entertainment and enjoyment, with merry-makers and performers of all kinds turning out to demonstrate their talents.

At night, the sponsoring Houses throw a party, one each night of the Gathering, where the nobility take in the finest of the musicians and performers from the Gathering. These evenings often see a great many tap rooms and festhalls filled as well, for those musicians who don't quite make the cut to be invited to perform for the nobility can always find a place in one of the many public nightspots of Waterdeep.

### Eleint

<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Eleint-10-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ The Matrons' Diversion"></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Eleint-21-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ Brightswords"></span>
<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Eleint-22-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ Pankration"></span>

***The Matrons' Diversion (Eleint 10):*** Over three generations ago, the Matron of House Melshimber invited the matrons of every other House that was led by a woman for a "genteel afternoon of cards and idle conversation". The ladies showed up in their very best, each with permission to bring along a daughter or niece, for what has become the foremost gathering time for the noble ladies of Waterdhavian society. Matrons take turns hosting these events, and there is tremendous pressure to successfully throw a successful event.

It is worth noting that a few of the Patrons of various noble Houses have idly discussed holding their own functions, but nothing on the level of the Matrons' Diversion has ever come of it.

***Brightswords (Eleint 21):*** 
![Eleint 21 Brightswords](compendium/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/11-volos-waterdeep-enchiridion/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#Eleint%2021%20Brightswords)

***The Pankration (Eleint 22):*** Another sporting event at the Fields of Triumph, the Pankration is made up of wrestling- and boxing-matches. Each House is expected to sponsor at least one athlete to engage in these bouts, and there is a specialized category of competition for those nobles who actually deign to enter the bouts themselves.

The wrestling is done Lathandran style, nude or nearly so and doused in temple-blessed oils, while the boxing is bare-knuckle and fought until one surrenders or simply can rise no more.

Multiple rings are set up in the Field itself, with space between them allowing observers to come down to watch any one of several simultaneous matches up close.

At about dusk, the Fields clear out, with nobles returning to clean up and change their clothes, while workers clear out and decorate the Fields. Once full night has settled in, great torches are lit atop the walls of the Fields of Triumph, and a party is thrown within.

## Autumn

### High Harvesttide (Festival)

**Harvesttide Hunts:** Often occupying several days on either side of this high festival, Waterdhavian nobles have taken to organize hunting retreats from the city (which is dreadfully hot around this time of year).

A few families with hunting lodges and the proper accommodations within a day or so of Waterdeep organize extended hunting excursions and invite their guests along. Though wardens and other servants tend to do the majority of the actual hunting, there is usually a prize prey of some sort (usually a stag or boar) that is hunted. The rest of the undertaking is generally an extended bout of drinking, eating, courting and the other merriments available to the nobility in the countryside.

### Marpenoth

<span class='ob-timelines' data-date='*-Marpenoth-03-00' data-name="ðŸ—“ Day of Wonders"></span>

***The Raising of the Guard (Marpenoth 11):*** An annual military exhibition in the Field of Triumph organized by Lord Piergeiron's offices, the Raising of the Guard celebrates the founding of the Guard and Watch in Waterdeep.

After the midday exhibition, a grand ball is held in Piergeiron's Palace, where snappily-dressed men and women in uniform mingle with the nobility and other important personages. Many jaded nobles like to think of this as a good time to take a soldier for an evening's bed companion, and more than a few soldiers have leveraged the contacts they made at such events into more lucrative careers with the Houses of Waterdeep.

***Gods' Day (Marpenoth 15):***
![Marpenoth 15 Gods' Day](compendium/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/11-volos-waterdeep-enchiridion/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#Marpenoth%2015%20Gods'%20Day)

***The Autumn Trousseau Festival (Marpenoth 23rd - 27):*** A festival dedicated to a series of parties that focus on the newest fashions for autumn and winter, and all culminate in exhibitions of the garment work of the finest artists of the Most Excellent Order of Weavers & Dyers, the Order of Master Tailors, Glovers & Mercers, and the Solemn Order of Recognized Furriers & Woolmen.

These shows are organized by noble patrons to highlight the work of one given tailors or group thereof, to both show off the nobles' good taste and to possibly garner additional regard for that artist's work.

***Liar's Night (Marpenoth 30):***
![Marpenoth 30 Liar's Night](compendium/adventures/waterdeep-dragon-heist/11-volos-waterdeep-enchiridion/volos-guide-4-splendors.md#Marpenoth%2030%20Liar's%20Night)

***The Five Feathers Event (Uktar 9 - 12):*** A four-day fair and sporting event in the Fields of Triumph, the Five Feathers hosts a handful of events such as archery buttes, hawking competitions and equestrian events. A great deal of betting goes on, and (as usual) the Houses are in fierce competition with one another to win the medals awarded the victors. During the days, athletics events occur, while at night, free-for-all parties fill the Fields of Triumph.

***Last Sheaf (Uktar 20):***

### Feast of the Moon (Festival)

**The Remembrance Revel:** Marking the end of the official Waterdhavian season, the Remembrance Revel begins with visits to the City of the Dead in the later part of the day, visiting House crypts and paying respects. In some ways, because so many nobles depart Waterdeep for the winter right after this event, it is a time to say goodbye to one's dearly departed, seeing them one last time until the following year.

As night falls, the normal curfew on the City of the Dead is lifted for one single night, and the nobility of the city host a grand masquerade revel, with laughter, song, dance and plenty of drink. The following day, most of those nobles who will be departing the city begin making their arrangements to do so; indeed, many of its most important members depart on ships or caravans the next day, leaving servants and less-important members of the House to close up the family's villa and operations for the winter.
