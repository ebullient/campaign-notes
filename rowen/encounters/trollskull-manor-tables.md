## Events

| Events |
| ------- |
| A spontaneous arm-wrestling competition breaks out. |
| A local kenku street gang comes into the tavern. They try to sell traveler’s dust to the patrons.(Traveler’s Dust: Tiny roseate crystals. A single grain is usually dropped into the eye, where it dissolves. Those using it are said to be walking the crimson road. Those using traveler’s dust often have trembling hands, slurred speech, and eyes the color of blood. Creates a euphoric feeling paired to a sensation of the world slowing down around you.) |
| PCs walk in to find a horse standing in the middle of the common room. No one can explain how it got there or who owns it. |
| A 12-year-old pickpocket named Stannis is working the crowd. His handler, a half-orc named Sabeen, is waiting outside. |
| A portal opens in the middle of the tavern. An elven wizard named Kyser Tameno walks out, orders a drink, and goes back through the portal. (He might become a regular) |
| The City Watch makes an arrest on the premises. |
| [Volo](../../faerûn/npcs/waterdeep/volothamp-geddarm.md) shows up and would like to make arrangements for a signing of *Volo’s Guide to Monsters*. Also has a number of questions regarding the haunting of Trollskull Manor for *Volo’s Guide to Spirits and Specters*. |
| Staff Event (e.g. Something the Kettlewhistles concoct... ) |
| You won a drunken wager with a peasant farmer, and have gained a wheel of cheese. |
| You knocked out a wanted thug in a drunken brawl, and now the whole town is talking about you. |
| You knocked out a wanted cutpurse in a drunken brawl, and were rewarded with the 30 gp bounty. |
| You won a drunken wager with a peasant farmer, and have gained a wheel of cheese. |

## Topics

| Tally Fellbranch |
| ------- |
| Introduces his brother, [Melannor Fellbranch](../../faerûn/npcs/waterdeep/melannor-fellbranch.md) |
| Offers his services to sculpt something that could be displayed on the wall. |
| He’s been commissioned to craft 8-foot-tall chess pieces for the Cragsmere Estate. It’s a major commission and he buys a round of drinks for everyone in the tavern to celebrate. |
^tally

| Embric & Avi |
| ------- |
| One of the Three Urchins has been shoplifting small metal trinkets from Steam and Steel. |
| Ask for an introduction to Renaer Neverember. |
| They’ve been hired to build a number of weapons of strange designs; serrated edges on odd surfaces, superfluous spikes, and the like. (Investigating this reveals that the commission can be tracked back to Grinda Garloth.) |
^genasi

| Fala Lefaliir |
| ------------ |
| Offers the PCs a sampler of foreign teas, in the interest of having them added to the menu. |
| Introduces [Ziraj the Hunter](../../faerûn/npcs/waterdeep/ziraj-the-hunter.md), a member of the Zhentarim Doom Raiders. |
^fala

| Vincent Trench |
| ------------ |
| Meeting a client. (Either a simple member of the public, or possibly one of the other notable patrons in the tavern.) |
| Looking to hire the PCs to contribute to one of his investigations: He needs a foppish young noble (Adric Thongolir, a half-steel dragon and youngest son of Lady Adiira Thongolir) followed. |
| Vincent has been hired to investigate a series of petty thefts in Thundercross Alley (running perpendicular to Thunderstaff Way just north of Sashtar Street). A man named Irbyth Authamaun has had a particularly valuable gray jade statuette of a stone giant stolen from his house (which lies at the eastern end of the alley). (The culprit is a small, floating, magical skull named Mortaunto. The curious undead rapscallion has created a small nest of his magpie-like thefts in the Thunderstaff Villa, which lies just north of Thundercross Alley.) |
^vincent

| Rishaal the Page-Turner |
| ------------ |
| Sits quietly in one corner, sipping tea and reading an oddly titled book: Duke Avanice’s Vile Poems, Cults of Ancient Netheril, Umbral Reflections on the Kingdom of Man, The Journal of Captain Arienthil’s Journeys in the Moonshae Isles, Memories of Kara-Tur, The Seventh Codex of the Numinous Ascendants of Kaal, The Atlas of Forgotten Cartographies. |
| Rishaal has a copy of Richelle’s Poems, a book of elvish poetry which was once one of Lif’s favorites. |
| His hands are bandaged. He came into possession of a cursed book that, when he touched it, caused his hands to burst out into boils. |
^rishaal

| MELOON WARDRAGON |
| ------------ |
| Challenges patrons to an arm-wrestling contest. |
| Under the influence of the intellect devourer, asks probing questions regarding the Grand Game hoping to glean actionable intelligence from the PCs or their associates. |
| PCs might notice he has a little purple fluid leaking out of his nose. (Potentially revealing the presence of the intellect devourer.) |
| Speaks of how his hometown, Loudwater, has come under the control of the Zhentarim. The current High Lord, Telbor Zazrek, is a well-paid puppet of the Zhentarim and, through him, the Black Network maintains a stranglehold on the town. Any supplies not provided by the Zhentarim are punitively taxed and the cost of living in the town has skyrocketed. |
^meloon

| FLOON BLAGMAAR |
| ------------ |
| He came here to meet with a pair of lovely brunettes, but now he needs help: *They’re sitting over there in the corner – don’t look! I’m supposed to just be ordering drink, but I recognize one of them as being the wife of Lord Elamyr Belabranta. If Lord Elamyr finds out, he’ll send a griffon to eat me!* (The Belabratas breed griffons for the City Watch.) |
| His friend Bruzmyr Seerambra can offer a much better deal on the cost of liquor and ale than the Vintners’ Guild. |
| His friend Riklyn Harvester has been transformed into an orange tabby cat by an irate sorcerer who was upset that Riklyn was trying to pick up a girl at the Old Skull Tavern. He’s got Riklyn with him (meow!) and he’s hoping the PCs can help turn him back. (Floon is mistaken: The cat is just a cat.) |
