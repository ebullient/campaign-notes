## Embezzlement: Cache of Dragons

In Waterdeep, a gold coin is called a dragon. *Before he was ousted from his position as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Dagult Neverember embezzled half a million dragons and hid them in a secret vault.* As a security precaution, he arranged for all knowledge of the vault's location and defenses to be magically erased from his mind and the minds of his subordinates. The wizard who performed the procedure trapped this knowledge within an artifact called the [Stone of Golorr](../../compendium/items/stone-of-golorr.md) The wizard disappeared shortly thereafter, and Dagult hid the stone in the Palace of Waterdeep.

Dagult was off rebuilding the city of Neverwinter when the other Lords of Waterdeep voted him out of office. He was banned from the city, which made it impossible for him to access the cache of dragons himself.

## The vault

Built long ago by dwarves, the vault is warded against all forms of magical detection and intrusion. Its current protector is an adult gold dragon named Aurinax, who is also the current wielder and guardian of the dragonstaff of Ahghairon, which has the power to prevent other dragons from entering the city. In exchange for the staff, [Aurinax](../../compendium/bestiary/dragon/aurinax.md) promised to guard the gold until such time as Neverember or his appointed vassals removed it.

## The "Grand Game"

Periodically throughout Waterdeep’s history the byzantine factions of the city — or some significant subset thereof — will become collectively fixated upon some objective. Thus will begin a Grand Game.

Sometimes the goal of a Grand Game will be arcane. Often it is clandestine, although quite public struggles are not unknown. (On no less than three occasions the Grand Game has revolved around the appointment of the Open Lord.) Whatever the case, the intense rivalries of the Grand Game give birth to all forms of subterfuge, covert activities, deception, and intrigue.

## Neverember's Enigma

This is very much the case with the current quest for Dagult Neverember’s vault. Obliquely referred to by many players of the Grand Game as ***Neverember’s Enigma***, the truth of the vault was sought even before the players realized it was a vault. 

- At first, it was merely known that the disgraced and ousted Neverember was keeping some momentous secret, and those involved in the Game yearned to discover what the former Open Lord of Waterdeep was hiding.
- When the vast scope of his embezzlement — a half million gold dragons! — came to light, however, many intuited the truth behind Neverember’s Enigma and its pursuit became even more frenzied.

> *The concept of the “Grand Game” was created to give a convenient label to the proceedings.* As the PCs are exposed to this label, it will help them conceptualize what they have become a part of. *It also elevates the hunt for the vault, tying it into the long history of the city and the rivalry of its factions.* As the PCs make the choice to join the Grand Game, it will be clear to them that they have crossed a threshold and become part of something larger than anything they have taken part in before. (And thus they themselves have become more important.)
> 
> *The terminology of “Neverember’s Enigma” is deliberately cryptic.* It allows the participants of the Grand Game to speak in code while wrapping their words in elliptical euphemisms, creating a sense of mystery which will invite the PCs to drive forward and discover the truth of what’s happening.

### Gang war brings the game out into the open

The gang war between Xanathar and the Zhenterim became the point at which everyone who knows what’s really going on in Waterdeep (or likes to think they do) became aware that a Grand Game was in progress. 

In the process, *Dagult Neverember became aware that it was Xanathar who had stolen the Stone of Golorr and he reassigns Dalakhar to infiltrate Xanathar’s organization and steal the Stone back.*

## Where did the money come from?

> A Death Masks nobles question, if I may. In Blackstaff Tower, we were told several houses were combined (ex: Phull + Ulbrinter = Phulbrinter, Belabranta + Eltorchul + Phylund = Belbrundel, Kothont + Thorp = Kothornt). In Death Masks, tho, we see some returned.  
> In these cases, did the combined house break apart into the original houses or does it still exist but the original houses have also been rebuilt from other family members outside Waterdeep?  
> Also, can we assume the dead houses as of BT (Anteos, Bladesemmer, Brossfeather, Estelmer, Gralhund, Hunabar, Melshimber, Thunderstaff) have also been restored, possibly as part of Laeral's restoration?
> ---
> You're very welcome! Fifty-odd years for me, and I consider myself the luckiest gamer alive. ;} Right, you pose a GREAT Realmslore question, so here we go...
> 
> Almost all of the combined noble houses and “dead” noble houses of Waterdeep are back. 
> 
> In a very few cases, relatives from distant farflung places all over Toril returned to claim them (and were able to prove their claims), but in the vast majority of cases, the noble houses were “restored” by the selling of noble titles (as seen in the superb CITY OF THE DEAD novel by Rosemary Jones). 
> 
> Lord Neverember saw it as an excellent way to line his own pockets, swell city coffers, and reward supporters (at the same time increasing his influence among the Masked Lords in future, as he could put forward candidates for lordship from among “his” new nobles—that is, nobles he ennobled, who came from  Neverwinter or who were his business associates, or who owed him money/favors).  
> 
> And yes, this happened offstage and shouldn't have, but with no novels or DRAGON articles of the old style or regular Realmslore web columns, opportunities to cover this sort of lore are fewer now.
