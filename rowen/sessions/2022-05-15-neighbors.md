# Session on 2022-05-15: Neighbors
<span class="nav">[← previous](2022-05-08-the-passive-fist.md) ~ ❦ ~ [next →](2022-05-22-neighbors-and-opening-night.md)</span>

## Summary
<span class='ob-timelines' data-class='rowen' data-date='1499-04-03-00' data-title="Meeting the neighbors">Making peace and a warning.</span>

After returning to the tavern and catching up on news while eating lunch, Rowen went to [The Bent Nail](../../faerûn/places/waterdeep/the-bent-nail.md) to meet Tally and thank him for the lovely sign. They started talking a bit, about wares in the shop and plans for Goldenight. Tally opened up a little about his issues with the genasi of Steam and Steel: it wasn't anything about them, specifically. Their together-ness made him miss his long-dead wife. He thought himself recovered, but seeing them together made him miss her terribly. Rowen expressed his sympathy, and asked if he could share the cause of Tally's discomfort with Avi and Embric, to which Tally agreed. Tally also made some plans to bring some things to be displayed at Trollskull Manor on Goldenight as well.

Rowen went almost directly across the street to [Steam and Steel](../../faerûn/places/waterdeep/steam-and-steel.md). Embric was working on something detailed, and the forge was hot. Avi lead Rowen on a dash along the building wall to the front room (Rowen realized he really really did not like being near hot furnace fire). Rowen introduced himself (even after Avi guessed who he must be), and Rowen explained, as delicately as he could, what the situation was with Tally.  Avi was very glad to know the nature of the reason, and determined that he and Embric would try to work things out with Tally again, but maybe with only one of them. With many thanks, Avi ushered Rowen out the front door of the shop (after one last discussion/confirmation of plans for displaying some items in the taproom of the Stone and Sky tavern on Goldenight).

Rowen did hustle back to the taproom, with a skip in his step for sorting out the interpersonal mess and earning a 20% discount for future purchases from Steam and Steel (which he knew Lidda would be all over). After relaying all of the news, he and Coral set out again to meet the rest of the neighbors. They headed out on to Saerdoun Street and headed west, stopping first at a building that had a signboard that had tiger stripes and a pair of eyes. After knocking on the door and waiting a moment, they were able to introduce themselves to Vincent Trench, a human private investigator who preferred to run his business primarily by word of mouth (discreetly). That said, the idea of having business cards on display in the new taproom was appealing, and he happened to have some... 

With a pocketful of business cards for [Tiger's Eye](../../faerûn/places/waterdeep/tigers-eye.md) and a small display stand, Rowen and Coral resumed their walk around the block. A few more doors down, they encountered a wood elf pacing in front of a storefront. They were protesting the source of the paper used by the store opener for books and spell scrolls. The owner emerged from the store, and begged Fala to leave him to run his business, and asked if Rowen and Coral could help him resolve this predicament. They entered [Book Wyrm's Treasure](../../faerûn/places/waterdeep/book-wyrms-treasure.md), leaving Fala outside. The store owner, [Rishaal the Page-Turner](../../faerûn/npcs/waterdeep/rishaal-the-page-turner.md), introduced himself and explained that Fala was protesting the source of the paper he uses for spell scrolls and spell books, but the paper must be very high quality, and he doesn't know enough people (book wyrm that he is) to have an easy time finding alternatives. Rowen and Coral agree to see what they can do. Rowen asked about trading some spellbooks he has found, and Rishaal confirmed that he would be able to trade them for something reasonable (correctly guessing that Rowen is a bard and not a wizard). Rowen and Coral also extended the offer to display something for the store in the taproom on Goldenight, and took their leave of Rishaal as he contemplated what cards for his shop should look like.

They met with Fala outside, and assured them they would help resolve the issue of where Rishaal's paper came from, but that it would take some time. Fala agreed to lead them to their shop in that case, so they could see a bigger part of the neighborhood. They rounded the corner onto Windborne Way, and Fala cautioned them about the owner of a new tavern called "Frewn's Brews." The owner gave them bad vibes (untrustworthy). Fala walked them the rest of the way to their shop, [Corellon's Crown](../../faerûn/places/waterdeep/corellons-crown.md). They passed [Path of Crumbs](../../faerûn/places/waterdeep/path-of-crumbs.md) and [Zephyr Post](../../faerûn/places/waterdeep/zephyr-post.md) along the way but did not stop in.  Fala's shop was well organized, full of herbs, soaps, essential oils, and a few potions for sale.  Fala has a potion of Water Breathing, and Rowen tossed out that he'd heard there have been some rumors of a new creature in the harbor. Fala hadn't heard that one, and had instead heard something about someone in the city stockpiling smoke powder of all things. Rowen and Coral extended the offer of something to display on Goldenight to Fala as well, before bidding a pleasant farewell, and making their way back through the center of the alley to the taproom.
